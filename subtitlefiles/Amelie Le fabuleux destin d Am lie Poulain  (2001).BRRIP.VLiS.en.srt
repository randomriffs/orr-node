1
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,200
On September 3, 1973

2
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,400
a blue fly capable of flapping
70 beats a minute

3
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,400
landed on St. Vincent Street
in Montmartre.

4
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,400
At that moment, on
a restaurant terrace nearby

5
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,800
the wind magically made
two glasses dance unseen

6
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,600
on a tablecloth.

7
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:10,300
Meanwhile, in a 5th-floor flat
on Avenue Trudaine, Paris 9

8
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,500
returning from
his best friend's funeral

9
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,300
Eugene Colere erased him
from his address book.

10
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,700
At the same moment,
a sperm with one X chromosome

11
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,300
belonging to Raphael Poulain

12
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,400
made a dash for an egg
in his wife Amandine.

13
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,500
Nine months later

14
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,100
Amelie Poulain was born.

15
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,000
AMELIE FROM MONTMARTRE

16
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,200
Her father,
an ex-Army doctor

17
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,000
works at a spa
at Enghien Les Bains.

18
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
TIGHT LIPS, HARD HEART

19
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,500
Raphael Poulain dislikes
peeing next to someone else.

20
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,100
He also dislikes

21
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,300
catching scornful glances
at his sandals

22
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,200
clingy wet swimming trunks.

23
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,200
Raphael Poulain likes

24
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,800
peeling large strips
of wallpaper

25
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,500
lining up
and shining his shoes

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,300
emptying his toolbox

27
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,300
cleaning it out

28
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,300
and putting
everything back.

29
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,800
Amelie's mother

30
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,800
a schoolmistress
from Grugeon

31
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,300
has always had shaky nerves.

32
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,700
FACIAL TWITCH, WEAK NERVES

33
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,100
She dislikes puckered fingers
in the bath

34
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,900
having her hands
touched by strangers

35
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,800
pillow marks on her cheek
in the morning.

36
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,400
Amandine Poulain likes figure
skaters' costumes on TV

37
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,600
polishing the parquet

38
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,300
emptying her handbag

39
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,200
cleaning it out

40
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,000
and putting
everything back.

41
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,900
Amelie is six.

42
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,300
Like all little girls, she'd
like to be hugged by her Daddy.

43
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,400
But he never touches her,
except for a monthly checkup.

44
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,100
The thrill
of this rare contact

45
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,600
makes her heart
beat like a drum.

46
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,400
As a result, he thinks
she has a heart defect.

47
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,900
Declared unfit for school

48
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,100
Amelie is taught by her mother.

49
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:21,400
The hens brood here henceforth.

50
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,100
- Four hens brood
- Very good.

51
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,000
- Hens fourth.
- No!

52
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,500
Deprived of playmates

53
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,000
slung between
a neurotic and an iceberg

54
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,900
Amelie retreats
into her imagination.

55
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,900
In this world,
LPs are made like pancakes.

56
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,600
The neighbor's comatose wife

57
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,400
has chosen to get
all her life's sleep in one go.

58
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,100
After this, I can stay awake
day and night.

59
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,000
Amelie has one friend, Blubber.

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,700
Alas, the home environment
has made Blubber suicidal.

61
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,700
Blubber's suicide attempts
destroy Mother's nerves.

62
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,300
A decision is made.

63
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,900
Enough!

64
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,600
To comfort Amelie, her mother
gives her a used Instamatic.

65
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,700
Little girl, look what you did!

66
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,200
A neighbor fools her

67
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,100
into thinking her camera
causes accidents.

68
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,800
Having taken pictures
all afternoon

69
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,600
Amelie is petrified.

70
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,800
She stares at the TV,
racked by the guilt

71
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,900
of causing a huge fire

72
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
two derailments

73
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,900
a jumbo jet crash.

74
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,800
A few days later

75
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,700
realizing she'd been had

76
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,600
Amelie gets her revenge.

77
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,000
What?!

78
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,500
One day, tragedy strikes.

79
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,200
Amandine takes Amelie
to Notre Dame

80
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,700
to pray for a baby brother.

81
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,300
Minutes later, heaven sends

82
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,300
alas, not a baby boy

83
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,500
but Marguerite,
a tourist from Quebec

84
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,400
bent on ending her life.

85
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,100
Amandine dies instantly.

86
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,000
After her mother's death

87
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,300
Amelie lives alone
with her father.

88
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,400
His unsociable tendencies
increase.

89
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,900
He's obsessed with building
a miniature shrine

90
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,900
to house his wife's ashes.

91
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,500
Days, months, and years go by.

92
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,100
In such a dead world,
Amelie prefers to dream

93
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,800
she'll earn enough
to leave home.

94
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,300
Five years later, she's
a waitress in Montmartre

95
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,500
at the Two Windmills.

96
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,300
It's August 29th.

97
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,300
In 48 hours, her life
will change forever

98
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,200
but she doesn't know it yet.

99
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,600
She lives quietly among
her coworkers and regulars.

100
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,000
Suzanne, the owner

101
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,100
limps a little
but never spills a drink.

102
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,200
A former bareback artiste,
she likes

103
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,800
athletes who cry
with disappointment.

104
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,000
She dislikes seeing men

105
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,400
humiliated
in front of their kids.

106
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,700
Georgette, the tobacconist,
is a hypochondriac

107
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,200
migraines one day,
sciatica the next.

108
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,900
She hates the words,
"fruit of thy womb."

109
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,100
Gina works with Amelie.
Her grandma was a healer.

110
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,000
She likes cracking bones.

111
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,400
She brings a kir to Hipolito,
a failed writer.

112
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,200
He likes seeing bullfighters
gored on TV.

113
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,500
Scowling at them is Joseph,
Gina's rejected lover.

114
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,200
He's always jealously
spying on her.

115
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,100
All he likes
is popping bubble wrap.

116
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,400
Here's Philomene,
an air hostess.

117
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,100
Amelie keeps her cat
when she's away.

118
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,700
Philomene likes

119
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,700
the sound of the cat's bowl
on the tiles.

120
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,700
The cat likes overhearing
children's stories.

121
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,300
No, thanks, ma'am.
I never work Sundays.

122
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:18,300
On weekends, Amelie often takes
a train to see her father.

123
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,100
- Why not use your retirement?
- To do what?

124
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,700
Travel.
You've never been away.

125
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,200
When we were young, your mother
and I longed to travel.

126
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,700
We couldn't,
because of your heart.

127
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,200
I know.

128
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,800
So, now

129
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,900
Now

130
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,600
Some Fridays,
Amelie sees a movie.

131
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,800
I like looking back
at people's faces in the dark.

132
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,200
I like noticing details
that no one else sees

133
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,700
but I hate it in old movies

134
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,900
when drivers
don't watch the road.

135
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,500
You know, you're
a very beautiful woman, Ellie.

136
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,900
- Why, Stan!
- A very, very beautiful woman.

137
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,300
Amelie has no boyfriend.

138
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,800
She tried once or twice,
but the results were a letdown.

139
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,700
Instead, she cultivates
a taste for small pleasures:

140
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,200
Dipping her hand
into sacks of grain

141
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,900
cracking crème brulee
with a teaspoon

142
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,500
and skipping stones
at St. Martin's Canal.

143
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,200
They call him "the Glass Man."

144
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,900
He was born with bones
as brittle as crystal.

145
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,800
All his furniture is padded.

146
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,900
A handshake
could crush his fingers.

147
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,400
He's stayed inside
for twenty years.

148
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,300
Time has changed nothing.

149
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,800
Amelie still seeks solitude.

150
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,900
She amuses herself
with silly questions

151
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,400
about the world below

152
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,800
such as, "how many couples
are having an orgasm now?"

153
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,000
Fifteen!

154
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,800
Finally, on August 30, 1997

155
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,100
comes the event
that changes her life forever.

156
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,600
Lady Di,
Princess of Wales

157
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,900
died in a car crash
last night

158
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,500
with her companion
Dodi Al-Fayed.

159
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,500
Only the discoverer
of Tutankhamen's tomb

160
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,200
would know how she felt

161
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,600
upon finding this treasure

162
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,400
hidden by a little boy
40 years ago.

163
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,500
On August 31 st at 4:00 a. M

164
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,200
Amelie had a dazzling idea.

165
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,100
Wherever he was, she would
find the box's owner

166
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,200
and give him back his treasure.

167
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,100
If he was touched, she'd
become a regular do-gooder.

168
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
If not, too bad.

169
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,700
The girl from the fifth floor.

170
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,000
We don't see much of you.

171
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,100
Would you know of a boy who
lived in my flat in the Fifties?

172
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,100
A boy?
Have a glass of port.

173
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,000
- No, thanks.
- Come in! Close the door.

174
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,200
Boys? I've known so many.

175
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,500
They're cute

176
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,900
until they discover
snowballs and chestnuts.

177
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,800
I've known so many boys.

178
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,000
When did you come here?

179
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,500
In '64.

180
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,300
You'll have heard the story?

181
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,600
No.

182
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,500
I'm amazed. Sit down.

183
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,200
My husband worked
for Ladybird Insurance.

184
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,700
It's no secret
he slept with his secretary.

185
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,700
They used every hotel around.

186
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,500
Not cheap ones, either.

187
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,800
The bimbo
liked spreading her legs

188
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,400
but only on satin

189
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,400
so he swiped from the till

190
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,500
a little at first,
then 50 million.

191
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,800
Off they flew to Panama.

192
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,100
Drink up.

193
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,200
On January 20, 1970

194
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,700
my doorbell rang.

195
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,800
"Your husband's been killed in
a car crash in South America."

196
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,000
My life stopped there.

197
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,200
Black Lion died of heartbreak.

198
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,500
Poor creature.

199
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,400
See how lovingly
he stares at his master?

200
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,400
I'll read you his letters.

201
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,200
Don't go!

202
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,000
You can spare 5 minutes.

203
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,900
He wrote this
from the Army camp.

204
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,200
"Darling Mado"

205
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,900
That's me Madeleine.

206
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,000
"I can't sleep, can't eat

207
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,100
"knowing that my only reason
to live is far away in Paris

208
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,400
"and I won't see her
until next Friday

209
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,100
"when my sweet little weasel
appears at the station

210
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,200
"in her blue dress."

211
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,200
In brackets"the one
you think is too transparent."

212
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,200
Did anyone ever write you
like that?

213
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,300
I'm nobody's little weasel.

214
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,000
My name is Madeleine Wells.

215
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,100
Madeleine,
like Mary Magdalene.

216
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,800
She wept, right?

217
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,100
Wells, as in water.
Talk about being born to cry!

218
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,300
About your question

219
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,800
ask Collignon, the grocer.
He's lived here all his life.

220
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,300
Hello, Amelie-mellow!

221
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,900
A fig and three nuts, as usual?

222
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,700
Who lived in my flat
in the Fifties?

223
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,600
What was their name?

224
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,800
You've got me there, dear.

225
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,900
In 1950, I was two
the mental age of a cretin.

226
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,400
The "cretin" is Lucien.

227
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,500
He's no genius,
but Amelie likes him.

228
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
She likes the way

229
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,900
he handles each endive
like a precious object

230
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,100
to be treated with care.
It's his way of showing

231
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,400
his love of good work.

232
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,700
Look at him!

233
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,200
Like he's nursing a baby bird!

234
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,900
Don't ask him for currants.

235
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,600
You'd be here till Monday!

236
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,800
Get moving, spastic!

237
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,900
She hasn't got all day!

238
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,700
Go see my mother.
She has an elephant's memory.

239
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,900
Elephant mom!

240
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,700
Thank you.

241
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,400
Bredoteau.

242
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,000
Pardon?

243
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,700
The name you're after.

244
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,300
But if I say it, it won't count.
I'm senile.

245
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,300
Ignore him. He's senile.

246
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,000
See what he's done
to my laurel?

247
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,300
His old job
was punching metro tickets.

248
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,300
Now he gets up every night

249
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,500
to punch holes in my laurel!

250
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,100
Too bad it's not hardy.

251
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,300
We all need a way to relax.

252
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,600
I skip stones.

253
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,300
- You do?
- I'll find it, don't worry.

254
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,800
I'm very organized.

255
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,800
- I like everything.
- Like what?

256
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,400
Your son's nearly fifty,
and I'm still doing

257
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,600
his bookkeeping!

258
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,300
You were still squeezing
his toothpaste at fifteen.

259
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,800
- It follows.
- Camus

260
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,800
second floor,
Broussard was on B block

261
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,500
Got it!

262
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,600
Bredoteau, fifth floor.

263
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,300
They were northerners.

264
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,300
Bredoteau.

265
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,800
What more I can say?

266
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:25,500
How could I live

267
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:35,000
Never to know the joy
that you give

268
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,500
When I'm in your arms

269
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:45,700
I'm under your charms

270
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:53,200
How could I live

271
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,400
Without you

272
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,900
Groping under the photo booth

273
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,500
is Nino Quincampoix.

274
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:33,700
When Amelie lacked playmates,
Nino had too many.

275
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,400
Five miles apart,
they both dreamed

276
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,900
of having
a brother and sister

277
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,000
to be with all the time.

278
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,900
Hi, Dad.

279
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,300
A new friend?

280
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,800
I've had him for years.

281
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,100
Your mother hated him,
so he lived in the tool shed.

282
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,900
There. Let's reconcile them.

283
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,500
There. How about that?

284
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,400
Dad, if you found a precious
relic from your childhood

285
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,200
how would you feel?
Happy? Sad? Nostalgic?

286
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,900
This gnome isn't a relic.

287
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,800
He was a retirement gift
from my old regiment.

288
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:59,400
No, I mean something you hid,
like a secret treasure.

289
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,400
I should varnish him
before the autumn.

290
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,600
I'll make some tea.
You want some?

291
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,800
Breathe in. Hold still.

292
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,300
Better now?

293
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,500
Shut the door!

294
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,600
There's a howling gale.

295
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,600
It's not Siberia.

296
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,000
You're not allergic
to car fumes!

297
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,400
I almost coughed up my pleura
last night.

298
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,100
Cough up a pleura?

299
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,900
- What's on today, Suzanne?
- Endives au gratin.

300
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,800
They'll have you on your knees.

301
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,000
That's good?

302
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,800
- Depends where you fall.
- Lf in front of the toilet

303
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,500
Not good.

304
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,000
12:15 laughs orgasmically
to attract alpha male.

305
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
He's gonna drive me berserk.

306
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,700
Can't he give up?
There are plenty of other bars!

307
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,200
Good-bye.

308
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,000
Madame Suzanne?

309
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,400
Madame Suzanne?

310
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,800
"Au gratin"
means white sauce, right?

311
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,500
Yes. Why?

312
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,500
I can't stomach it,
like you and horse meat.

313
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,800
It's not my stomach,
it's my memory.

314
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,100
I'd rather cook human flesh.

315
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
You're kidding.

316
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,800
Madame Suzanne,
can I leave early today?

317
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
What's his name?

318
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,800
Dominique Bredoteau.

319
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,400
Hello.

320
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,400
You're Dominique Bredoteau?

321
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,800
That's me.

322
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,700
Why?

323
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,300
It's about the petition.

324
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,800
Petition?

325
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,600
Yes. The petition to

326
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,900
to canonize Lady Di!

327
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,600
No, thanks.

328
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,400
No.

329
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,700
Ladies and gentlemen

330
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,100
sorry to bother you

331
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,000
Yes?

332
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,800
Hello. I'm looking
for Dominique Bredoteau

333
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,800
for the European census.

334
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,100
Come up, third floor.

335
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,600
Hello, kitten.

336
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,100
Earl Grey?

337
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,200
Jasmine?

338
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,300
What will you have?

339
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,600
I'm busy.

340
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,000
Here. Coming!

341
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:17,100
Where can I find
Dominique Bredoteau?

342
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,800
Poor dear! You just missed him.

343
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Look, there he goes now.

344
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,600
Bretod-eau.

345
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,600
Not Bredot-eau.

346
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,500
You need a little mulled wine.

347
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,800
Come in.

348
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,200
I've lived here for five years.
I never saw you before.

349
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,000
I never go out on the landing.

350
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,100
I'm fussy about who I meet.

351
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
They're all bums.

352
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,800
Come in.

353
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,900
They call me the Glass Man

354
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,700
but my name is Raymond Dufayel.

355
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,800
Amelie Poulain.
I'm a waitress at

356
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,800
The Two Windmills. I know.

357
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:29,300
And right now,
your Bredoteau basket is empty.

358
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,200
Because it's not "do."
It's "to."

359
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,600
Like "Toto."

360
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
I love that painting.

361
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,200
It's the Luncheon
of the Boating Party.

362
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,700
By Renoir.

363
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,600
I've painted one each year
for twenty years.

364
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,900
The hardest part is the looks.

365
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,800
I sometimes feel like

366
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,000
they deliberately change
their mood behind my back.

367
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,900
They look quite happy.

368
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,900
They should be!

369
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,100
They're eating hare
with morels

370
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,100
and waffles with jam
for the kids.

371
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:24,000
Now, where's
that piece of paper?

372
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:31,100
You've noticed my video camera.

373
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,800
A gift from my sister-in-law.

374
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,800
I put it there

375
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,900
so I don't need
to wind up my clocks.

376
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,800
After all these years

377
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,100
the only person
I still can't capture

378
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,000
is the girl
with the glass of water.

379
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,900
She's in the middle,
yet she's outside.

380
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,600
Maybe she's just different.

381
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,000
In what way?

382
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,000
I don't know.

383
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,900
When she was little, she rarely
played with other kids.

384
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,400
Maybe never.

385
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,200
Dominique

386
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,800
Dominique Bretodeau,
27 Rue Mouffetard.

387
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,700
It's for you.

388
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,400
Every Tuesday morning

389
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,200
Dominique Bretodeau
buys a chicken.

390
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,500
He roasts it with potatoes.

391
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,800
After carving
the legs and wings

392
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,900
he loves picking the hot carcass
with his fingers

393
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,200
starting with the oysters.

394
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,700
But not today.
Bretodeau won't buy a chicken.

395
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,700
He'll go no further
than this phone booth here.

396
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,500
In a flash, it all came back

397
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,800
Bahamontes
winning the Tour de France.

398
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,900
Aunt Josette's slips.

399
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,700
And most of all,
the tragic day

400
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,500
The day he won all the marbles.

401
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,100
The pinch, Bretodeau!

402
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,600
Bretodeau,
does he know what it is?

403
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,400
Cognac, please.

404
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,800
Amazing, what just happened.

405
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,200
It must be my guardian angel.

406
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,500
The phone booth
was calling me

407
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,400
Same here!
The microwave's calling me.

408
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,000
I'll have another cognac.

409
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,000
Life's funny.

410
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,000
To a kid, time always drags.
Suddenly you're fifty.

411
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,100
All that's left
of your childhood

412
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,100
fits in a rusty little box.

413
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,100
You got kids, Miss?

414
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,200
I have a daughter
about your age.

415
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,100
We haven't spoken for years.

416
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,100
I heard she had a child, a boy.

417
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,100
His name is Lucas.

418
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:31,200
It's time I looked them up,
before I'm in a box myself.

419
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,200
Don't you think?

420
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,300
Amelie has a strange feeling
of absolute harmony.

421
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,200
It's a perfect moment.
Soft light

422
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,200
a scent in the air,
the quiet murmur of the city.

423
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,700
She breathes deeply.
Life is simple and clear.

424
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,000
A surge of love, an urge
to help mankind comes over her.

425
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,800
Let me help you.
Step down. Here we go!

426
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,600
The drum major's widow!

427
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,100
She's worn his coat
since the day he died.

428
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,800
The horse's head
has lost an ear!

429
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,800
That's the florist laughing.
He has crinkly eyes.

430
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,000
In the bakery window, lollipops.

431
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,100
Smell that!
They're giving out melon slices.

432
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,200
Sugarplum ice cream!

433
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,300
We're passing the park butcher.

434
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,400
Ham, 79 francs.
Spareribs, 45!

435
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,200
Now the cheese shop. Picadors
are 12.90. Cabecaus 23.50.

436
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,800
A baby's watching a dog
that's watching the chickens.

437
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,800
Now we're at the kiosk
by the metro.

438
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,000
I'll leave you here. Bye!

439
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,600
"She can't relate
to other people."

440
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,400
"She was always a lonely child."

441
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,700
On a sparkling evening
in July

442
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,600
while on the beaches,
holiday hordes

443
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,100
relax in the new-found sun

444
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,900
and Paris's
sweltering denizens

445
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,100
gaze at the star bursts
of the traditional fireworks

446
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,600
Amelie Poulain

447
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:25,000
Godmother of Outcasts,
Madonna of the Unloved

448
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,100
finally succumbed to exhaustion.

449
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:32,100
In Paris's stricken streets

450
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,200
a countless throng
of mourners

451
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,900
lined her funeral route
in silence

452
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,800
with the measureless grief
of newly orphaned children.

453
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,100
What a strange destiny
for one who gave her all

454
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:53,800
yet took such joy
in life's simple pleasures.

455
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,700
Like Don Quixote,
she pitted herself

456
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:01,800
against the grinding windmills
of all life's miseries.

457
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,500
It was a losing battle

458
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:19,600
that claimed her life too soon.
At barely 23, Amelie Poulain

459
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,700
let her young, tired body
merge

460
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,700
with the ebb and flow
of universal woe.

461
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,600
As she went,
she felt a stab of regret

462
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,000
for letting her father die

463
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
without trying
to give his stifled life

464
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,900
the breath of air
she had given

465
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,300
to so many others.

466
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,100
Wait!

467
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,500
Wait!

468
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,100
Wait!

469
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,200
Wait! Wait! Wait!

470
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,100
Wait! Wait!

471
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,000
Pages full of dual ID photos

472
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,800
torn up and discarded
by their owners

473
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,200
carefully reassembled
by some oddball.

474
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,900
Some family album!

475
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,100
A pack of Gaulaises.

476
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,600
Just a second.
It's so smoky in here.

477
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,200
Where are they?
I can't see a thing.

478
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,800
More to the left.
More

479
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,800
You need change.

480
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,400
Forget it.

481
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,000
A mauresque for the young man.

482
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,600
One kir, one mauresque,
and two mint sodas.

483
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,000
Was that prenuptial
or post-smooching?

484
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,100
Are you a congenital schmuck?

485
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,100
- Prenuptial.
- Don't worry.

486
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,100
You'll find your Mr. Right
one day.

487
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,600
All women want to sleep
on a man's shoulder.

488
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,900
All men snore
after a few drinks

489
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,900
and I have a musical ear.

490
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,100
I had my nasal cavities fixed.

491
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,200
I see you're a born romantic.

492
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,800
I see you've never known
true love.

493
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,700
I did. It shortened my leg.

494
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,000
I thought you fell off a horse.

495
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,600
I did.

496
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,100
I was in love
with a trapeze artist.

497
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,600
Stupid me. They always
drop you at the last minute.

498
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,300
He dropped me
just before my act.

499
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:38,100
It floored me.
Plus the horse

500
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,100
with me under it.

501
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,400
The mauresque?

502
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,400
Still, true love does exist.

503
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,400
I know.
After 30 years behind a bar

504
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,100
I'm an expert.
I'll even give you the recipe.

505
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,200
Take two regulars

506
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,500
mix them together
and let them stew.

507
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,500
It never fails.

508
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,700
Excuse me!

509
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,400
Excuse me!

510
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,300
I'll go.

511
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,000
Haven't you hurt enough people?

512
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,500
Gina can defend herself.

513
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,900
I don't mean Gina.
I mean Georgette.

514
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:42,200
Look!
She craves your attention

515
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,200
but all you can see is Gina.

516
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,500
Poor girl!
The things she does

517
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,200
to catch your eye!

518
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,600
You really must be blind.

519
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I'm off on a date. Bye!

520
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,800
Whoever her new one is

521
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,300
he can't be worse than that nut
with his tape recorder.

522
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,200
Joseph's not so nutty.

523
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,100
He's just in pain.

524
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,100
Come on!
They split up two months ago.

525
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,700
To keep on coming here,
he must be a masochist.

526
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,100
Don't say you haven't noticed.

527
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,900
Noticed what?

528
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,800
Well, he always
sits here, right?

529
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,000
At number 8?

530
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,300
Sit down.

531
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,100
Sit down, Georgette.

532
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,700
What can you see?

533
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,000
My cigarette counter.

534
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,200
Nothing's missing?

535
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,700
Well, no.

536
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,300
Make an effort.

537
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,000
I can't see what!

538
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,700
Think about it. Good night.

539
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,100
Letter Arrives 30 Years Late.

540
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,800
A mailbag found by climbers
on a glacier on Mont Blanc

541
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,800
was part of a cargo

542
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:42,100
lost in a plane crash
in the late 1960s.

543
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,000
So sad. A young,
pretty princess for once.

544
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,500
It's OK if she's old and ugly?

545
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,700
Sure! Look at Mother Teresa.

546
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,100
Is he still chasing Gina?

547
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,600
No, he has somebody else.

548
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,800
Anyone I know?

549
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,300
Funny about this glacier

550
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,000
Somebody at the Two Windmills?

551
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,400
Not you!

552
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,000
Not Suzanne

553
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,600
- No!
- Yes.

554
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,000
There he is again.

555
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,600
How strange.

556
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,000
- And here.
- "Him again!"

557
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,700
"Lyon Station."

558
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,300
And here.
"March 5, Austerlitz."

559
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,200
Always the same blank face.
Always neutral.

560
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,800
Twelve times.

561
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:47,200
I counted. It's very odd.

562
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,600
Why keep taking your picture
all over town

563
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,600
and throw them away?

564
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,100
Good one, too.

565
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,600
It's like a ritual.

566
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,300
He's probably terrified
of growing old.

567
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,700
It's his only consolation.

568
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,800
He's dead!

569
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,000
He's scared of being forgotten.

570
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,200
He wants to remind people
of his face.

571
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,700
Like faxing his portrait
from the afterlife.

572
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,900
A dead man
scared of being forgotten.

573
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
These guys here
have it made!

574
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,200
They're long dead

575
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,100
but they'll never be forgotten.

576
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,700
The girl with the glass

577
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,400
Maybe her thoughts
are with somebody else.

578
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,300
Somebody in the picture?

579
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,600
More likely a boy
she saw somewhere

580
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:53,200
and felt an affinity with.

581
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,800
You mean she'd rather
imagine herself

582
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,400
relating to an absent person

583
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,900
than build relationships

584
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,200
with those around her?

585
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:12,000
Maybe she tries hard to fix
other people's messy lives.

586
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
What about her?

587
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,100
Her own messy life?

588
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,600
Who'll fix that?

589
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,800
It's better to help people
than a garden gnome.

590
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,800
The trucker had 2.8 grams
of alcohol in his blood!

591
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,200
Makes me sick.

592
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,300
Talk about employing
irresponsible morons!

593
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,500
- Your keys.
- Hold on, Mello.

594
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,700
Speed kills nowadays.

595
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,100
Model yourself on Lucien.

596
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:58,800
No radar will ever catch him
while he's working!

597
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,400
Shame on you, Mr. Collignon.

598
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,400
It's not his fault.

599
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,100
True, Mrs. Couchoix.

600
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,800
It's not his fault
he can't sleep.

601
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,200
It's Lady Di's.

602
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,400
Guess what I found
in the truck?

603
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,800
A lingerie catalog.

604
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,800
He'd pasted Lady Di's face
over the model's!

605
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,500
What today?
Five asparagus

606
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,500
or more local history?

607
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,900
Nothing.

608
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,800
KEYS CUT WHILE YOU WAIT

609
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,600
The migraine's better?

610
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:58,600
Yes, but my sciatica
kept me awake all night.

611
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,000
It's ages since I saw you
looking so good.

612
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,200
Oh, yeah?

613
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:07,700
"A woman without love wilts
like a flower without sun."

614
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,800
Strange weather today!

615
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,600
What's so funny?

616
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,100
You're only the 100th one
to say it.

617
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:24,200
We pass the time of day
to forget how time passes.

618
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,800
We do it to keep
from taking crap.

619
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,500
I write crap
that nobody publishes.

620
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,100
- Another rejection?
- My 30th!

621
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,600
Isn't your cousin a book critic?

622
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,700
Forget it!
Critics are like leeches

623
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,900
sucking the blood of writers.

624
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,300
Is your book

625
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,600
a love story?

626
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,700
It's about a guy
who keeps a journal.

627
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,100
Not about his past

628
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,000
but about disasters
in his future.

629
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,200
So he gets depressed
and does nothing.

630
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,300
Basically, it's about a loafer.

631
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,500
I'll dedicate
the manuscript to you.

632
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,400
So you'll write off his tab.

633
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,600
His scribbles for my nibbles.
That's sponsorship.

634
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,300
What took you so long?

635
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,900
Look at the time!

636
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,000
Somebody peed in his mother!

637
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,500
FOOT CREAM

638
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,600
TOOTHPASTE

639
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,200
"Without you,
today's emotions

640
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,700
"would be the scurf
of yesterday's."

641
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,700
"Without you,
today's emotion's

642
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,300
"would be the scurf
of yesterday's."

643
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,800
Without you,
today's emotions

644
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,700
would be the scurf
of yesterday's.

645
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,100
Tickets, please.

646
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,800
How's work?

647
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,700
You asked me already.

648
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,900
You OK these days?

649
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,600
Pretty much.

650
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,900
I feel a change.

651
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,900
I had two heart attacks,
an abortion, did crack

652
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,400
while I was pregnant.

653
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,100
Other than that, I'm fine.

654
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,700
Good.

655
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,500
Something wrong?

656
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,700
No, nothing.

657
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,100
Your gnome's gone.

658
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,900
Is he back in the tool shed?

659
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,900
Moscow.

660
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,200
There. See?

661
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,400
No explanation.

662
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,600
He wants to see the world?

663
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,400
I can't understand it.

664
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,700
LOST

665
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,900
BAG

666
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,800
PHOTOS

667
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,800
Any normal girl
would call the number

668
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,900
meet him, return the album

669
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:37,300
and see if her dream is viable.

670
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:42,800
It's called a reality check.
The last thing Amelie wants.

671
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,700
I say!

672
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,300
Could she be falling in love?

673
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,700
Where's the boss?

674
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,100
Sleeping in the cauliflower.

675
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,800
What?

676
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,300
Sleeping in the cauliflower.

677
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,900
You want me want what?

678
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,400
A scratch card, please.

679
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,000
How does it work?

680
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,700
Tell you what.

681
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,400
Let's both do one together.

682
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:11,400
You scratch it here

683
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,000
sideways.

684
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,200
Nothing. You?

685
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,000
Me, neither.

686
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,200
Unlucky at cards

687
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,400
So they say.

688
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,100
I have to get back.

689
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,800
Yes.

690
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,600
Porno Video Palace.

691
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,300
I'm calling about the ad.

692
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,800
- You're over 18?
- Yes.

693
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,100
- Shaved?
- Sorry?

694
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:05,300
Are you shaved?
Fur pie doesn't sell.

695
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,000
How's life, Mrs. Wells?

696
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,600
When you've nothing
to live for

697
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,300
Come on, life's great!

698
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,900
Dream on, kid.

699
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,300
Hello, Mr. Dufayel.

700
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:55,000
Here's your order, Mr. Dufayel.

701
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,600
I doubt it. I hate artichokes.

702
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,500
You shouldn't. Watch this.

703
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,400
Take it.

704
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,200
That's better.

705
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,300
Lucien, you're a wizard!

706
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,000
Courtesy of Mr. Collignon.

707
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,800
Mister Collignon?

708
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,600
Sorry, it slipped out.

709
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,800
Practice, Lucien!

710
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:46,500
Practice! Repeat after me.

711
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,800
Collignon, down the john.

712
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,600
Collignon, down the john.

713
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,300
Your turn now. Collignon

714
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,900
Collignon, big moron!

715
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:04,700
See? You can do it.

716
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,300
Collignon, dead and gone!

717
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,600
Very good!

718
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:13,600
Collignon, big moron,
down the john!

719
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,900
OK! That's enough for today.

720
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,900
Lucien, that's enough!

721
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,700
Very good.

722
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,300
I found this under your mat.

723
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,800
Still no win!

724
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:59,000
Me, neither.

725
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,300
May I?

726
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,900
There's a little

727
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:15,300
You're gorgeous when you blush.

728
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,700
Like a wild flower.

729
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:21,100
It's my dyspepsia.

730
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,800
Morning, all!

731
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,600
Beautiful day.

732
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,200
Pack of Gitanes, please.

733
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:51,300
Bravo! Vive la France!
You scalded me!

734
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:55,800
Ten out of ten! Bull's-eye!

735
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,300
It was Amelie, she

736
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,700
When they went up Mont Blanc

737
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:43,100
the silicon in her face
froze up.

738
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:47,000
Her face was a festering mass!

739
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:17,300
Mulled wine and spice cookies.

740
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:22,900
I was too hard on the girl
with the glass.

741
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:28,600
Tell me about that boy she saw.
Did they meet again?

742
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,700
They're into different things.

743
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,300
Luck is like the Tour de France.

744
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:40,100
You wait,
and it flashes past you.

745
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:44,600
You have to catch it
while you can.

746
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,200
Can I help you?

747
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,200
Excuse me.
I found this in the street.

748
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:16,100
Nino will be glad!

749
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,400
He was so sad the other day.

750
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,400
I almost prayed to St. Anthony!

751
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,200
Is Nino here now?

752
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,000
On Wednesdays
he works at the funfair.

753
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,400
How long has
he had this collection?

754
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:36,100
Since I got him the job here,
last year.

755
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:40,200
Before, he collected footprints.
He worked nights.

756
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:46,200
In the daytime, he took pictures
of footprints in wet cement.

757
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,700
He's a funny guy.

758
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,700
When we met,
he was a Santa Claus.

759
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,800
Other things, like

760
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:59,700
whenever he heard a funny laugh,
he'd tape it.

761
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,000
Gosh!

762
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,200
Must be hard for his girlfriend.

763
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,600
He never keeps them long.

764
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,400
Times are hard for dreamers.

765
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:18,100
Eva! Are those coffees coming?

766
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,000
Gotta go. Thanks for the album.

767
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,900
It's OK. I have time
to take it to the funfair.

768
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:28,100
Suit yourself. The Ghost Train.
Ask for Nino Quincompoix.

769
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,500
Is Nino here?

770
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:58,100
He doesn't get in till 7:00.

771
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:59,400
Is there no way
to see him before?

772
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,400
Sure. 20 francs.

773
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,000
See you next Wednesday.

774
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,000
5 p.m. Tomorrow,
Montmartre carousel.

775
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:32,100
Bring 5 francs.

776
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,400
Want to know about her?

777
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,800
- You know her?
- You bet!

778
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,600
She put us in her shirt pocket.

779
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,500
Next to her breast.

780
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:07,400
- Is she pretty?
- Not bad.

781
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,600
- Beautiful.
- No. Pretty.

782
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,100
- Beautiful!
- Pretty.

783
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:14,800
- What does she want from me?
- She's broke.

784
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,800
She wants a reward
for the album.

785
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,900
Or else
she collects photos, too.

786
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:25,300
She wants to trade us for
a one-eyed man with glasses!

787
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,400
No, you dope!

788
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,900
She's in love.

789
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,600
- I don't even know her.
- You do.

790
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,500
Since when?

791
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,300
Since always.

792
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,800
In your dreams.

793
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,400
You! Man with the plastic bag!
It's for you.

794
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:14,900
Follow the blue arrows,
Mr. Quincompoix.

795
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:43,200
The fool looks at a finger
that points at the sky

796
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:00,200
I know the stranger
in the pictures.

797
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:04,300
He's a ghost. He's invisible!

798
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,700
He only appears
when the film is developed.

799
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:11,200
When a girl
has her photo taken

800
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:15,200
he goes "Wooo!" in her ear

801
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,200
while he fondles her neck.

802
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,800
That's how he got caught,
Mr. Quincompoix!

803
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:24,800
Who are you?

804
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,000
Page St.

805
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,500
DO YOU

806
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,800
WANT

807
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,800
TO MEET ME?

808
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:23,200
Listen to this. "Boy of 6,
while parents sleep

809
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,700
"drives off in a pedal car.

810
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:29,500
"Found on a highway
in Germany

811
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:33,100
"he told police
he wanted to see the stars."

812
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:36,800
Ain't life beautiful, though?

813
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,100
Love.
The only bug she hadn't caught.

814
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:44,600
- Nobody's immune.
- It gives me a break.

815
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,800
Love's a great beautician.

816
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,800
What's she like?
Tall, small? Fair, dark?

817
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:58,300
Let's say average height.

818
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:02,400
Not a dwarf or a giraffe.
Normal.

819
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,800
Pretty, for her type.

820
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:09,700
As for fair or dark,
it's hard to say.

821
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:13,100
She wasn't a redhead.
Unless

822
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:15,100
Forget it.

823
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:19,700
I remember she casually asked
about your girlfriend.

824
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:21,100
And?

825
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:24,800
I said you weren't interested,
right?

826
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,400
You didn't!

827
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:29,200
What do you care?
You don't even know her.

828
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:33,900
- Exactly. It's the mystery.
- You won't find mystery here.

829
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:36,200
A pound of nectarines.

830
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:39,200
The ones here
are the prettiest.

831
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,300
Trust him. He's an artist.

832
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:44,400
He goes home
with a ton of unsold stock.

833
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,500
What for? Is he stewing a pig?

834
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,900
No, sir! He's studying art!

835
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,400
Sells leeks all day long
and paints turnips all night!

836
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,800
The boy's a useless vegetable!

837
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,200
With a prompter

838
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:01,100
in each cellar window
whispering comebacks

839
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:03,700
shy people
would have the last laugh.

840
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,400
At least
you'll never be a vegetable!

841
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:11,300
Even artichokes have hearts.

842
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:16,000
You'll never be a vegetable.
Even artichokes have hearts!

843
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:21,000
"Darling Mado, I miss you
more and more each day.

844
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:24,400
"I'm an exile
in a world of dreary khaki.

845
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,400
"I can't sleep, can't eat

846
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,500
"This camp was
the mistake of my life

847
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:33,400
"depriving me of my beloved
for five long weeks.

848
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:37,600
"I think of you endlessly.
Your Adrien."

849
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:43,300
"I turned down my last month's
wages instead of giving notice.

850
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:47,200
"I dream of better times ahead.

851
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:51,100
"An orange-colored day.
Remember, my love?

852
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:53,300
"Your everloving Adrien."

853
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,400
"Good news, sweetheart.

854
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:59,900
"Soon I'll be able
to afford a car

855
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:02,500
"and drive home every night.

856
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:07,500
"Till then, meet me on Friday,
and we'll go out."

857
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:56,000
MOTHER

Psychiatric Helpline.

859
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,800
WHERE & WHEN?

860
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:48,000
One hour later,
on Boulevard St. Martin

861
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:52,600
Amelie walks into a party goods
and costume shop.

862
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:57,100
At the same time, a man leaves
his home on Rue Lecourbe.

863
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:02,800
26 minutes later,
Amelie is at East Station.

864
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:11,200
Simultaneously, the man
in red shoes parks outside.

865
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:15,600
The time is exactly 11:40.

866
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,400
At this precise moment

867
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:07,700
only Amelie has the key to
the riddle of the mystery man.

868
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,800
How's it going, Mrs. Wells?

869
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,800
Not so bad
when it's not raining.

870
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:19,800
- This is for you.
- Me?

871
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:32,800
"Dear Mrs. Wells, we recently
recovered a mailbag

872
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,000
"that was lost
in a plane crash

873

"on October 12th, 1969,
on Mont Blanc.

letter to your address

875

for the uncustomary delay.

876
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:51,300
"Jacques Grasjeau,
Customer Services."

877
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:55,600
"Darling Mado, I'm in exile.
I can't sleep, can't eat

878
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,400

"one orange-colored day.
Your everloving Adrien."

885
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:51,800
Another package for you.

886
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,800
You heard about the concierge?

887
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,300
She got a letter.

888
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:12,200
From her husband, 40 years late.

889
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,200
That's a lot, isn't it?

890
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:32,200
I'm not big on still life,
Mr. Dufayel.

891
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,400
Then work on your lean layer.

892
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:38,200
Fat over lean. Always!

893
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:03,100
I heard
there'll soon be a new star.

894
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:06,300
You're into stars now?

895
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:10,400
I saw it on TV at my ma's,
that's why.

896
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:14,000
I dunno if it's true.

897
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:16,900
In America

898
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:20,500
they'll take
rich people's ashes

899
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,500
put them in a satellite

900
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,600
and shoot it into space.

901
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:27,000
It's going to shine forever.

902
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,300
And Lady Di

903
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,600
will they do the same for her?

904
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:39,000
Lady Di! Lady Di!
Give it a rest!

905
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,900
I can't concentrate!

906
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:46,800
Lady Di! Lady Di!

907
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,700
Renoir!

908
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,900
I don't understand.

909
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,600
Brilliant! You were perfect.

910
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,500
Did it work?

911
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,100
It's getting there.

912
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:06,000
Ask me again anytime.
The harm's done.

913
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:09,700
- Harm?
- Everybody calls me Snow White!

914
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:18,300
The Two Windmills at 4 p.m.

915
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:30,800
Could you stand in for me
at 4:00?

916
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,200
Again?

917
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:42,800
What's eating him?

918
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:47,100
- I smile too much.
- He'd rather you frowned?

919
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,200
With other men, yes.

920
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:57,100
Nino is late. Amelie can
only see two explanations.

921
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,100
1 He didn't get the photo.

922
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,500
2 Before he could
assemble it

923
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:07,800
a gang of bank robbers
took him hostage.

924
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:10,400
The cops gave chase.

925
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:13,900
They got away
but he caused a crash.

926
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:20,200
When he came to,
he'd lost his memory.

927
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:22,100
An ex-con picked him up

928
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:27,300
mistook him for a fugitive
and shipped him to Istanbul.

929
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:29,600
There he met
some Afghan raiders

930
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:33,200
who took him to steal
some Russian warheads.

931
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:40,700
But their truck hit a mine
in Tajikistan.

932
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:44,000
He survived,
took to the hills

933
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,400
and became a Mujaheddin.

934
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:49,500
Amelie refuses
to get upset for a guy

935
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:53,900
who'll eat borscht all his life
in a hat like a tea cozy.

936
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
- What can I get you?
- Coffee, please.

937
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,400
TODAY'S MENU

938
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:20,800
He's understood.

939
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:24,100
He's going to put down
his spoon

940
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:29,100
dip his finger in the sugar

941
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,900
turn around slowly
and speak to me.

942
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,800
Is this you?

943
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,800
Yes, it's you.

944
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:25,300
- More coffee?
- No thanks.

945
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:51,600
So it's this man here,
with his hand up?

946
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:58,700
Is she in love with him?

947
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:07,400
I think it's time
she took a real risk.

948
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:12,000
She might.
She's devising a stratagem.

949
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,300
She's fond of stratagems.

950
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:22,600
In fact, she's cowardly.

951
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:28,100
That's why
I can't capture her look.

952
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:34,700
Dufayel's attempts to meddle
are intolerable!

953
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:43,400
If Amelie chooses
to live in a dream

954
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:47,700
and remain
an introverted young woman

955
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:52,100
she has an absolute right
to mess up her life!

956
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:28,600
What are you doing?

957
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,400
Tell me, Lucien.

958
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:38,700
For deliveries, do you keep
keys to all the apartments?

959
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:54,500
One of your booths
is out of order.

960
01:40:57,100 --> 01:41:00,400
It seems to be jammed.

961
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,500
East Station ticket hall.

962
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:08,200
Buy a video, get one free?

963
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,500
Samantha?

964
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:31,200
Can you stand in for me at

965
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:55,600
Photo booth. East Station.
Tuesday 5 p.m.

966
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:11,900
Almost done.

967
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:21,000
The mystery man wasn't a ghost
or a man scared of aging

968
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
but simply the repairman

969
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,000
a normal technician
doing his work.

970
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:18,100
He keeps spying on me.
It's making me sick.

971
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:22,600
4:05: Blatant female conspiracy.

972
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:25,200
Gosh, you're tense!

973
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:28,400
Good luck. You'll need it.

974
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:38,700
Excuse me.
Did you put this in my pocket?

975
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:41,900
- Yes, but it's not from me.
- I know. Where is she?

976
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,700
She's at her father's.

977
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:46,300
It bothers me.
Can I talk to you?

978
01:44:47,700 --> 01:44:49,200
I get off at 6:00.

979
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:51,500
- Can you come back?
- OK.

980
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:53,300
See you then.

981
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:57,500
4:08: Docking scheduled.

982
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:34,100
A blond guy in a camel coat.
Absent-minded, too.

983
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:36,400
How come?

984
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:38,800
He came back
three times the same day.

985
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:41,500
1:12

986
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:42,700
Camel coat.

987
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:43,900
2:50

988
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,800
Camel coat.

989
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:49,300
- 4:17.
- Stop it!

990
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:52,300
My rash has come back!
Look. Suzanne!

991
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:56,100
My rash is back.
He's driving me nuts!

992
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:58,300
Lay off!

993
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:02,600
Her conscience is at fault.

994
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:04,600
I've had it! I'm going home.

995
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:09,100
Psychos are the last straw!

996
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:15,900
Stop smothering them.
Women need air.

997
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,300
You give them air,
they blow you off.

998
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:21,200
Fresh air's healthy.

999
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:23,000
Cram it, failure!

1000
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,500
Failed writer, failed life

1001
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:30,100
I love the word "fail."

1002
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:32,300
Failure is human destiny.

1003
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,100
It's gasbag time!

1004
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:37,100
Failure teaches us
that life is but a draft

1005
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:42,400
a long rehearsal for a show
that will never play.

1006
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,800
I bet he stole that.

1007
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:47,300
I do have some original ideas

1008
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:51,400
but people always steal them.

1009
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:52,800
Same as your women.

1010
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:54,900
Meaning?

1011
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:58,200
You'd better get used to it.

1012
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:00,900
Speak for yourself, you

1013
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:08,200
- What's going on?
- Nothing much.

1014
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:10,500
Georgette went out,
Joseph got mad.

1015
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:12,000
"Went out"?

1016
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:15,100
Like Gina.
You know who Gina's with?

1017
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:17,300
The guy with the plastic bag!

1018
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:22,000
I saw their little game.

1019
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:23,800
The note in the coat pocket.

1020
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:25,900
4:08.

1021
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:29,400
Back he comes, and hey presto!
Out they go.

1022
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:36,900
I'm worried for Amelie
because I like you.

1023
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,300
What do you mean?

1024
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:41,600
By and large, the men I like
are mentally unsound.

1025
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:43,700
I'd like to know more
about you.

1026
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:44,900
Ask me.

1027
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:50,500
One swallow doesn't make?

1028
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:52,100
A swallow?

1029
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:54,700
A summer.

1030
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:56,500
Practice makes

1031
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:58,000
Perfect.

1032
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,600
- Curiosity
- Killed the cat.

1033
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,200
- Haste
- Makes waste.

1034
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:03,000
- Rolling stone
- Gathers no moss.

1035
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,100
- It's a sin
- To steal a pin.

1036
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:08,800
- Absence makes
- The heart grow fonder.

1037
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:10,600
- Not bad.
- You collect them?

1038
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:15,500
At home, we say a man who knows
proverbs can't be all bad.

1039
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:23,300
Pretty girl from
the fifth floor, listen to this!

1040
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:27,600
- You believe in miracles?
- Not today.

1041
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:29,600
You're in for a surprise.

1042
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:33,600
What if I told you
that a team of climbers

1043
01:48:33,700 --> 01:48:37,000
on Mont Blanc had found

1044
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:42,000
hard proof
that my husband loved me?

1045
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:17,200
Lucien, I need some yeast.

1046
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:20,800
For Miss Amelie? She's baking
her famous plum cake?

1047
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:23,000
Collignon! Go!

1048
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:24,800
I'll be right back.

1049
01:50:51,300 --> 01:50:53,900
I'll be back.

1050
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:25,900
Go into the bedroom,
Miss Poulain.

1051
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:45,500
So, little Amelie

1052
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:49,600
your bones aren't made of glass.

1053
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:52,800
You can take life's knocks.

1054
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:57,300
If you let this chance go by

1055
01:51:58,300 --> 01:52:04,000
eventually,
your heart will become

1056
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:09,200
as dry and brittle
as my skeleton.

1057
01:52:11,700 --> 01:52:13,200
So

1058
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:17,000
go get him, for Pete's sake!

1059
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:05,300
"Without you,
today's emotions

1060
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:07,100
"would be the scurf
of yesterday's."

1061
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,800
International airport.

1062
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:12,800
September 28, 1997.
It is exactly 11 a.m.

1063
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:15,600
At the funfair,
near the ghost train

1064
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:18,900
the marshmallow twister's
twisting

1065
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:21,800
while in Villette Park,
Felix Lerbier

1066
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:24,300
learns there are more links
in his brain

1067
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:27,000
than atoms in the universe.

1068
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:30,400
At the Sacre Coeur

1069
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:32,300
the Cardinals are practicing
their backhands.

1070
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:35,000
The temperature
is 24 degrees Celsius.

1071
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:36,900
Humidity, 70%.

1072
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:40,300
Atmospheric pressure,
999 millibars.

1073
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,300
{{{the end}}
