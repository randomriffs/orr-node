00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:37,437
Any similarities between certain
characters in this book and real people

2
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:40,287
is due entirely to insight into
human nature. " Gunther Strobbe

3
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:48,041
I was an author, even if that
sounds ridiculous for an author.

4
00:00:51,248 --> 00:00:53,887
I was the author of an
unnoticed collection of poems

5
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:58,479
published in the year
blankety-blank by a crummy publisher.

6
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:02,925
As a result, I wasn't,
in fact, an author at all.

7
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:11,362
From the publishers to which I'd sent
the manuscript of my latest masterpiece,

8
00:01:11,568 --> 00:01:14,560
all I received were standard
letters of rejection.

9
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:20,407
What did they know?

10
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:27,763
I had to write and I'd keep on
writing until I became an author.

11
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:30,444
My day would come.

12
00:01:30,648 --> 00:01:32,161
It had to come.

13
00:01:33,448 --> 00:01:37,236
THE MISFORTUNATES

14
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:57,523
I lived in a strange place.

15
00:01:57,728 --> 00:01:59,446
For God's sake, Dad!

16
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:03,840
Sorry, son.

17
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:08,405
A godforsaken hole where, once a
year, real men shaved their legs,

18
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:12,999
dressed as women and then
partied for 3 days and 3 nights.

19
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,641
There you are.

20
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:18,439
Write those lines nicely, son.

21
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:21,481
I was forced to forego the
annual purification ritual

22
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:24,964
until I was able to
call myself a real man.

23
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:30,317
Or rather, was able to
call myself a real Strobbe.

24
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:05,637
You're not taking our telly away?
- I don't have to take it away

25
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:09,602
if you pay me what you owe,
on the spot. Can you do that?

26
00:03:09,808 --> 00:03:15,166
Beefcake couldn't. And none
of his brothers could help him.

27
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:18,997
My dad Celle couldn't, nor
Uncle Petrol nor Uncle Koen.

28
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,277
Unfortunately!

29
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:42,121
I was 13 and was irrevocably
destined to become like them.

30
00:03:42,328 --> 00:03:47,960
I, too, as a young member of the Strobbe
tribe, would defend my name with honour.

31
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:58,004
It's not even my telly,
it's our mother's.

32
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:02,963
That's as may be, but you're domiciled
here so this is where we have to come.

33
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:07,127
D'you see? That's the law.
- Take a look at my mother for a moment.

34
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:10,877
Because all 4 brothers
had messed up their lives,

35
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:13,204
they'd moved back
in with their mother.

36
00:04:13,408 --> 00:04:18,198
A woman who was one in a million and
whose heart was bigger than her pension.

37
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:20,041
Hi, ma.

38
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,525
A Pieta with 4 big, goofy sons.

39
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:29,361
Each evening she fell asleep in front
of her TV, watching some soap or other.

40
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:31,877
Would you take her
only pleasure away?

41
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:47,119
Dad, my bike is buggered.
- Sir, I regret to have to say this

42
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:51,401
but in order to become a bailiff
you have to be an enormous bastard!

43
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:54,283
Or you'd never be
able to do your job!

44
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:59,717
The bailiff's visit was
thanks to Beefcake's gambling.

45
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:05,083
He'd rather naively thought that slot
machines had been designed by altruists.

46
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:09,167
Calling Beefcake a born loser may be
going too far. On the other hand...

47
00:05:09,368 --> 00:05:14,840
He'd never win a single bet,
contest or game. Never ever.

48
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,640
Fuck, pal!

49
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:22,164
Uncle Koen was lucky when it came
to gambling but was unlucky in love.

50
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:27,840
His sad expression and innate
melancholy made women want to mother him.

51
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:30,926
And because he'd got most
of his conquests pregnant,

52
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:34,723
he spent a fortune on
maintenance payments.

53
00:05:34,928 --> 00:05:39,080
For him too there was no pleasanter
place of refuge than the parental home.

54
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:44,408
Hey, Ma, what are you up to?
- I can't give him a dirty telly.

55
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:47,918
Fuckin' hell! This prick's
ransacking our home and you...

56
00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:52,560
Houses with 5 bedrooms were reserved
for children of a greater god.

57
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:55,566
And so I shared a
room with Uncle Petrol.

58
00:05:55,808 --> 00:06:00,598
With only 8 years between us,
he could have been my brother.

59
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:23,085
Here's your ketchup, you
deep-fried bag of grease!

60
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:29,523
Nothing pleased me more than when that
gentle gangster called me 'kid brother'.

61
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:34,123
There.

62
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:36,487
Here. Take that.

63
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:43,405
Take that one too. What?
It's still a good chair.

64
00:06:47,888 --> 00:06:50,925
Lowie is a bit
of a hothead, sir.

65
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:54,806
Take whatever you like. The
less we've got, the better.

66
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:59,206
It's true, isn't it,
Beefcake? Hey, bailiff,

67
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:03,447
possessions possess you.
And not the other way round.

68
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:05,081
You can have that
advice for free.

69
00:07:05,288 --> 00:07:09,759
For my father, possessions
just meant extra dusting.

70
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:14,007
Now none of us have got anything any
more. No wife and no other furniture!

71
00:07:14,888 --> 00:07:18,437
His entire postman's salary was
blown every week in the local bars.

72
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:20,798
Give us another drop, Agnes.

73
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:25,399
This was his way of protecting us
from the temptations of capitalism.

74
00:07:26,928 --> 00:07:32,844
What's up with you?
- My bike's buggered.

75
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:37,766
Use your feet. Run.
- To school? Are you mad? It's 5 km.

76
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:42,723
A real man runs. I've done
a lot of running in my life.

77
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:48,161
I've won competitions. I even
won a gas cooker for your mum.

78
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,598
Your mum was really pleased.

79
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:55,527
Fuck.

80
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:59,798
For God's sake, pal.
- Fuck.

81
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:05,520
Look at the 2 of us in this
photo. Don't we look happy?

82
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:10,236
Why can't you two
get back together?

83
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:16,284
It's not that simple.
- You could give it a go.

84
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:19,283
Yeah.

85
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:23,163
Yeah.

86
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:25,763
That's a good one.

87
00:08:38,688 --> 00:08:42,317
Gunther, go and get me some loo roll.
- I've gotta go.

88
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:46,680
Hey, the loo roll's all gone.

89
00:08:46,888 --> 00:08:50,278
Ma, go and get me some loo roll.

90
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:53,440
Ma!

91
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:19,204
Strobbe!

92
00:09:20,048 --> 00:09:24,246
If you don't learn to be on time, you'll
end up picking up shit behind a train.

93
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:27,884
5 pages by tomorrow.

94
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:30,204
What about, sir?
- What about, sir?

95
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:33,445
About true colours,
in 4 different shades!

96
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:35,798
And now, out!

97
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:48,007
Well, Strobbe, been
thrown out again?

98
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:58,157
This is Franky De... Dewulf? A new
pupil. D'you have a place for him?

99
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:10,200
I've heard... that your father
has quite a few problems.

100
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:14,481
That he likes a drink.
- People say a lot of things.

101
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:16,804
Isn't it true, then?
- No.

102
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:21,684
Growing up in those conditions
and that environment isn't healthy.

103
00:10:22,528 --> 00:10:25,361
Wouldn't you be better off
boarding during the week?

104
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:31,165
So you can do your homework. And
you can go home at the weekend.

105
00:10:32,288 --> 00:10:36,042
Don't you think that'd be better?
- No.

106
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:40,603
Right, you can go.

107
00:11:03,848 --> 00:11:05,440
Bye.
- Bye.

108
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:28,283
Oops...

109
00:11:44,888 --> 00:11:47,243
The TV was gone.

110
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:51,885
Everyone agreed this
was Beefcake's fault.

111
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:56,559
So he'd been instructed
to come up with a solution.

112
00:11:56,848 --> 00:11:58,361
Hi.
- Hi.

113
00:11:58,568 --> 00:12:03,358
Welcome.
- Petrol, Gunther, Celle, Koen.

114
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:06,162
The Strobbes.
- My name's Siawash.

115
00:12:06,368 --> 00:12:08,404
Sia-what?
- Siawash.

116
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:12,487
Like "car wash"?
- This is my wife, Mehri.

117
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:17,485
Thank you.
- Hello. You... know... Roy Orbison?

118
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:22,239
No. Is he from Belgium?
- Roy Orbison. An American singer.

119
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:25,758
From Texas. He's Texan.
- A singer from America.

120
00:12:26,468 --> 00:12:30,678
Only the Lonely. His biggest hit.
- Don't you know it?

121
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:36,846
Roy Orbison... tonight... for
the first time... singing again.

122
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,882
Can we watch it
on your telly, pal?

123
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:43,841
We can? That's brilliant.
Hello, little lady.

124
00:12:44,048 --> 00:12:47,165
No, don't trouble yourself,
we'll drink out of the bottle.

125
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:50,326
That's typically Belgian,
drinking out of the bottle.

126
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:53,964
This is typical too. Watch.

127
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:58,199
Right then, bon appétit.

128
00:12:58,408 --> 00:13:01,957
To Iraq.
- Iran. We're from Iran.

129
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,399
That too.
- To Belgium.

130
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:10,641
To Roy Orbison.

131
00:13:39,048 --> 00:13:45,237
My dad had compared the Strobbes'
timelines to that of our Texan idol.

132
00:13:45,488 --> 00:13:51,597
He saw nothing but parallels between Roy
Orbison's life and that of the Strobbes.

133
00:13:51,808 --> 00:13:55,437
The singer's high points coincided
with our family's pinnacles

134
00:13:55,648 --> 00:13:59,357
and we also plumbed life's
depths at the same time.

135
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:05,006
So Roy's comeback had to mean
a turning-point for us too.

136
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,199
His resurrection
was our resurrection.

137
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:22,521
Fantastic!

138
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,283
Fantastic!

139
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:30,839
We're gonna have a dance.

140
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:37,925
Are we gonna have a dance?
Shall we have a dance?

141
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:23,964
We could feel it. Roy's
return had upended history.

142
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:29,037
We had no choice but to prepare
for a period of intense happiness.

143
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:34,121
No, no. Gunther,
no. No, son, no.

144
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:37,877
The shopping!
- Give here. No.

145
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,002
Gherkins!
- The shopping!

146
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:01,838
That's for a new bike.

147
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:16,043
I'm off to see your Mum.

148
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:36,760
Nice-looking chicks?

149
00:17:43,968 --> 00:17:47,756
Real life starts the
first time you fuck, kid.

150
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:53,998
You know, play hide the
sausage. Have a good fuck.

151
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,278
Have you already fucked a chick?

152
00:17:56,488 --> 00:18:00,606
You can tell me. Have you
already made a chick yodel?

153
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,085
Did you see my Mum?
- Yes.

154
00:18:13,288 --> 00:18:17,520
Did you talk to her?
- No. It was a bad idea, son.

155
00:18:17,728 --> 00:18:21,926
That really was a bad idea,
that was. The filthy whore.

156
00:18:25,128 --> 00:18:26,322
Come here.

157
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:33,839
We won't let this get to us.
We won't be pushed around.

158
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:35,845
By that slut.

159
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,484
13 YEARS & 11 MONTHS PREVIOUSLY

160
00:18:40,688 --> 00:18:43,725
Keep still a minute. Don't move.

161
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:47,765
And thus, with a quickie against
the wall of the Las Vegas,

162
00:18:47,968 --> 00:18:52,678
my father unwittingly brought his
life as a bachelor to an abrupt end.

163
00:18:57,368 --> 00:19:01,122
42 weeks later, he
was in the Las Vegas

164
00:19:01,328 --> 00:19:06,243
when the telephone rang and my
father heard that he had a son.

165
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:10,436
The miracle has taken place
The miracle has taken place

166
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:16,280
It started when I let your dick use my
pussy as a parking space. All together!

167
00:19:16,928 --> 00:19:21,524
Then he came and fetched me from the
hospital and went back to the Las Vegas

168
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:25,004
to proudly show me
off to all his friends.

169
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:28,839
Cheers, son.

170
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:58,481
27 years after I was born, I made
the same stupid mistake as my father.

171
00:20:18,728 --> 00:20:22,926
You should have taken the pill. All
that rubbish about it being bad for you.

172
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:25,164
And now it's too late.

173
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,799
How long have you known?

174
00:20:30,768 --> 00:20:36,525
How far gone are you? There's a
limit on when you can get rid of it.

175
00:20:37,328 --> 00:20:39,284
So it's that simple for you?
- Yes. It is...

176
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,242
We're not going to start this
again. We've already been through it.

177
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,438
I don't want to get rid of it.

178
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:54,007
I don't want kids.
I really don't.

179
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:58,527
You don't have the
right to force it on me.

180
00:20:59,848 --> 00:21:03,477
But you don't have
the right to deny me.

181
00:21:05,048 --> 00:21:09,644
If you don't get rid of
it, I'm off. D'you hear me?

182
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:13,158
I refuse to get rid of it.
- OK.

183
00:21:36,168 --> 00:21:40,207
Gunther, I love you.

184
00:23:56,648 --> 00:24:01,005
See what I get to eat
since your mother left?

185
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:04,280
I've always cooked
you nice meals.

186
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:12,598
Writing lines again, son?
- Yes, sort of.

187
00:24:12,808 --> 00:24:17,484
But actually, I'm taking the piss out
of the teachers, they never read it.

188
00:24:17,688 --> 00:24:20,407
Don't they read it?
- No.

189
00:24:21,088 --> 00:24:26,685
Write this. Granny's got hairy tits.
- Very funny.

190
00:24:26,888 --> 00:24:27,843
I'm going to bed.

191
00:24:32,288 --> 00:24:34,483
He has written it down, too!

192
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:37,007
Good one.

193
00:24:40,768 --> 00:24:44,363
Dad, I'd like to
board during the week.

194
00:24:45,928 --> 00:24:48,840
Board?
- May I?

195
00:24:52,608 --> 00:24:57,523
What's this crap about
boarding? What's that all about?

196
00:24:59,728 --> 00:25:03,960
I bust my balls for you. I do my
best, but it's never good enough.

197
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:07,956
It's never good enough.
First your mother and now you.

198
00:25:08,168 --> 00:25:11,877
You're a little traitor,
that's what you are.

199
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:16,285
And that filthy whore. I always
knew she was a filthy whore.

200
00:25:16,488 --> 00:25:23,360
And you are the son of a filthy
whore. That's what you are.

201
00:25:24,088 --> 00:25:27,842
I'm starting to wonder
whether you are actually mine.

202
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:32,519
Are you mine? Take
your trousers off.

203
00:25:32,728 --> 00:25:33,843
What?
- Do it.

204
00:25:34,048 --> 00:25:36,687
Why?
- Stand up and take your trousers off.

205
00:25:37,408 --> 00:25:40,320
Gunther, take... Stand up!

206
00:25:40,528 --> 00:25:42,405
Hey!
- Take your trousers off.

207
00:25:43,928 --> 00:25:47,079
You do know how to take them
off, don't you? Bloody hell.

208
00:25:47,928 --> 00:25:51,238
Come on. There.
Yours is the same.

209
00:25:51,568 --> 00:25:56,323
Look. Yours is identical to mine.
You're my son. You're my son.

210
00:25:56,528 --> 00:25:59,326
You've even got a
birthmark in the same place.

211
00:26:00,968 --> 00:26:04,483
It's a fine specimen.
You've got a nice one.

212
00:26:05,688 --> 00:26:07,838
I don't suppose you've
done much with it yet.

213
00:26:08,048 --> 00:26:09,481
Or have you?
- No.

214
00:26:11,088 --> 00:26:16,287
Gunther, you're going to get a
great deal of pleasure from it.

215
00:26:16,488 --> 00:26:22,597
Life still has to start for you.
- I don't feel very well.

216
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:40,637
Feeling a bit better now?
- Yes. It was the wine.

217
00:26:41,848 --> 00:26:49,357
A bit pissed? That's OK.
That's part of growing up.

218
00:27:29,088 --> 00:27:32,364
The bigger I got, the
smaller everything seemed.

219
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:35,402
I got fed up with Franky.

220
00:27:36,248 --> 00:27:39,365
But he, or rather his
father, beat me to it.

221
00:27:40,128 --> 00:27:42,403
Dad says I'm not allowed
to play with you any more.

222
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:45,363
How come?
- Your father is crazy

223
00:27:45,568 --> 00:27:50,961
and your whole family is scum.
- And my mother abandoned me, Franky.

224
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,841
Didn't your dad tell you that too?
- Don't blame me.

225
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:58,599
It's my dad. Honestly. He says you'll
teach me to smoke, drink, steal...

226
00:28:01,008 --> 00:28:05,923
I'm not blaming you. But I don't
know if you know much about us.

227
00:28:06,128 --> 00:28:09,165
If your dad thinks he
knows the Strobbes so well,

228
00:28:09,368 --> 00:28:12,041
he must know that the
Strobbes all pull together.

229
00:28:12,248 --> 00:28:14,762
What?
- No one lays a finger on a Strobbe.

230
00:28:14,968 --> 00:28:19,644
We're a bit old-fashioned as far as
that is concerned. D'you understand?

231
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:21,042
Family honour and stuff.

232
00:28:21,688 --> 00:28:24,361
You'll understand when Uncle
Petrol punches you in the gob!

233
00:28:24,568 --> 00:28:27,321
And your father will
be dealt with too.

234
00:28:27,648 --> 00:28:30,082
No one calls my father crazy.

235
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,083
The cops were at the door.

236
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:47,848
But they...
- Franky's father made a complaint.

237
00:28:48,048 --> 00:28:51,802
Threatening his family! Are you mad?
- They say that you're crazy...

238
00:28:52,008 --> 00:28:57,002
You're going... to keep your mouth shut.
- Listen.

239
00:28:57,208 --> 00:29:01,918
But they say...
- I told you to keep your mouth shut.

240
00:29:03,128 --> 00:29:05,198
But they...
- Listen. Listen.

241
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,126
But they...
- Let him speak.

242
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:11,446
I'm talking to my son!
- And I'm talking to mine!

243
00:29:13,448 --> 00:29:17,077
Go on, say it.
- They say you're crazy.

244
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:21,122
And that our whole family is
scum and that you're an alkie.

245
00:29:27,408 --> 00:29:28,921
Marcel.
- Bloody hell!

246
00:29:29,128 --> 00:29:33,997
Marcel! Lowie, Pieter!
- Let go of me.

247
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:38,486
You...
- Marcel. No!

248
00:29:39,888 --> 00:29:44,484
Pieter. Pieter, Lowie,
come here! Come here, quick!

249
00:29:45,648 --> 00:29:48,924
Come here. Stay here.

250
00:29:52,848 --> 00:29:56,238
Come on. Come here.
Come here. Come on.

251
00:29:59,488 --> 00:30:03,766
The bloody little sod...
- Everything's OK.

252
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:28,967
Hey, kid brother. Come on.

253
00:30:35,128 --> 00:30:40,566
The cops said if you carry on like
that they'll put you in an institution.

254
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,364
The idea freaks your dad out.

255
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:48,597
You mustn't do that.
- He mustn't hit me.

256
00:30:48,808 --> 00:30:54,963
He won't hit you
again. Say I said so.

257
00:30:55,688 --> 00:31:00,887
I'm not going back.
- A Strobbe doesn't run away.

258
00:31:01,088 --> 00:31:03,602
Are you a Strobbe or not?

259
00:31:27,048 --> 00:31:31,121
Gunther. A small portion
with ketchup, as usual?

260
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:35,799
No, a small portion with
gravy and mayonnaise.

261
00:31:36,008 --> 00:31:38,841
It's for my dad.
- Right.

262
00:32:11,408 --> 00:32:16,357
Omer, the manager of the Liars Pub, was
good at attracting a crowd to his place.

263
00:32:17,648 --> 00:32:21,766
After his legendary naked cycling
race, he came up with the idea

264
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:27,247
of trying to break the world record
for drinking beer. He sought candidates.

265
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:31,521
I'm not crazy, Omer. Drinking as a
sport, that's going a bit too far.

266
00:32:33,248 --> 00:32:34,203
Another beer.

267
00:32:51,448 --> 00:32:55,123
My father was a social
drinker, not a competitive one.

268
00:32:55,328 --> 00:32:57,637
Petrol had had his
fill of top-level sport.

269
00:32:57,968 --> 00:33:02,962
After his naked-cycling defeat, Beefcake
would've liked to get the better of Koen

270
00:33:03,168 --> 00:33:08,561
but was excluded as a candidate
because he was blacklisted by Omer.

271
00:33:10,648 --> 00:33:13,321
So Koen would defend
the Strobbes' honour.

272
00:33:13,528 --> 00:33:19,364
You'll never do it. You'll
bring shame on the Strobbes.

273
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:22,924
If only to piss Beefcake off.

274
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:25,926
Fuckin' hell! I
should've taken part.

275
00:33:28,128 --> 00:33:30,562
There. That'll make
you nice and thirsty.

276
00:33:30,768 --> 00:33:32,520
Leave that alone.
- Go on, just one.

277
00:33:32,728 --> 00:33:37,722
You've got to work up a thirst.
- Go on, just one. Don't be stupid.

278
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:42,240
Line your stomach, work up a
thirst and then have a good shit.

279
00:33:45,088 --> 00:33:47,761
We're writing history
today, ladies and gentlemen.

280
00:33:47,968 --> 00:33:51,927
We are going to beat the world
record. No more and no less.

281
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:56,280
And earn a place in the
Guinness Book of Records.

282
00:34:08,008 --> 00:34:09,646
We're going to win.

283
00:34:31,728 --> 00:34:37,724
5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Go!

284
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:53,597
Take it easy! Start
calmly and finish calmly.

285
00:35:05,408 --> 00:35:09,037
And while my Uncle Koen
valiantly had a shot at glory,

286
00:35:09,248 --> 00:35:12,479
I wondered whether my life was
actually about to start soon.

287
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:49,397
Hey, Soi, they've got to go in.

288
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:51,644
They've got to go
in, not come out.

289
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:57,999
Alexi Noyens, Wieken, Winnetou,
Soi, Little Lucien, Oscar Crap,

290
00:35:58,568 --> 00:36:04,006
Arlette's Rudy, Zof, they were all
there. But none of them had any idea

291
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:09,646
that a Strobbe would
wipe the floor with them.

292
00:36:30,328 --> 00:36:35,482
As a result of my life being about to
begin, I missed Uncle Koen's victory.

293
00:36:35,688 --> 00:36:38,760
Like my dad who, that day,
away from curious eyes,

294
00:36:38,968 --> 00:36:44,167
had probably drunk more litres of
beer than most of the participants.

295
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:16,281
Bloody hell, Celle!

296
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:56,438
When it was over, he hightailed
out of there, to go for a drink.

297
00:38:52,488 --> 00:38:56,037
You're in the paper, pal! Look.

298
00:38:56,248 --> 00:38:58,045
Piss off, Beefcake, let him see.

299
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:02,241
Driving on the wrong side of the road,
Koen'd crashed head-on into a stolen car

300
00:39:03,648 --> 00:39:07,118
and taken out a gang
of criminals on the run.

301
00:39:07,328 --> 00:39:11,640
You should hang it on the wall.
- Leave it out.

302
00:39:16,008 --> 00:39:19,478
Mr. Strobbe? I'm going
to take your temperature.

303
00:39:19,688 --> 00:39:21,167
My temperature?

304
00:39:31,688 --> 00:39:36,125
Life went on, of course. That's
what makes it difficult sometimes.

305
00:39:58,048 --> 00:39:59,367
Gunther?

306
00:40:01,888 --> 00:40:03,162
Come here a minute.

307
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:08,681
It was obvious, poems
wouldn't pay for nurseries.

308
00:40:08,888 --> 00:40:11,004
Doing unwanted work

309
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:14,359
to pay for the existence
of an unwanted child,

310
00:40:14,568 --> 00:40:17,480
there was a certain logic to
it, when you thought about it.

311
00:40:17,688 --> 00:40:21,476
I've already told you numerous
time I can't help you. So fuck off!

312
00:40:27,248 --> 00:40:32,720
Good morning. Minibar.
Soft drinks, coffee. Anyone?

313
00:40:32,928 --> 00:40:35,488
I won't be coming
back. No? Sure?

314
00:40:54,128 --> 00:40:57,120
The train continues to wend
its way through my life.

315
00:40:57,328 --> 00:41:01,367
But you can forgive a train for a
lot of things. Because it's a train.

316
00:41:01,568 --> 00:41:05,402
Unlike a car, it travels
past the world's rear.

317
00:41:05,608 --> 00:41:09,601
The listed houses near the station
turn out to be little more than slums.

318
00:41:09,808 --> 00:41:13,517
But you only see the decay
from the railway track.

319
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:19,086
No vehicle gives you a more honest
impression of a country than a train.

320
00:41:19,968 --> 00:41:24,598
Look at our gardens, our
pigeon lofts, our sheds.

321
00:41:24,808 --> 00:41:27,561
See our underwear
drying on the line.

322
00:41:28,088 --> 00:41:31,842
Look at our garden gnomes,
our celery, our leeks,

323
00:41:32,568 --> 00:41:36,163
our verandas and
our brick barbecues.

324
00:41:40,928 --> 00:41:45,843
See how the cows gradually
make way for brick monsters,

325
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:48,801
which those with the
bank's approval but no taste

326
00:41:49,008 --> 00:41:51,158
have plumped down in
the Flemish countryside.

327
00:41:52,448 --> 00:41:55,997
Take the train and see
how, frozen to the spot,

328
00:41:56,208 --> 00:42:00,520
marble and granite stand next to
the track, bored and covered in dust,

329
00:42:00,728 --> 00:42:04,323
providing our loved ones
with a final resting place.

330
00:42:09,488 --> 00:42:13,083
The legendary boozer supreme,
Maurice Strobbe, left,

331
00:42:13,288 --> 00:42:17,725
after drinking himself to death at
49, in addition to a wife and 4 sons,

332
00:42:17,928 --> 00:42:22,797
an exceptionally beautiful
daughter, my Auntie Rosie.

333
00:42:23,008 --> 00:42:26,967
A month after my grandfather's death,
she had moved to far-off Antwerp

334
00:42:27,168 --> 00:42:30,080
and didn't want anything
more to do with Reetveerdegem.

335
00:42:58,968 --> 00:43:01,721
Is that there the toilet?
- Yes.

336
00:43:01,928 --> 00:43:06,399
Just a plank of wood with a hole in it?
- Yes. Let me have a shit.

337
00:43:13,528 --> 00:43:18,397
I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna
ram his balls down his throat!

338
00:43:18,608 --> 00:43:24,160
That's her father you're on about. I
don't want him talked about like that.

339
00:43:27,848 --> 00:43:33,684
And you're my sister. I
will always stand up for you.

340
00:43:35,088 --> 00:43:39,843
I don't want to know.
- No one lays a finger on a Strobbe!

341
00:43:41,088 --> 00:43:42,919
I'm not a Strobbe any more.

342
00:43:44,448 --> 00:43:48,043
What?
- I'm not a Strobbe any more.

343
00:43:51,168 --> 00:43:52,487
Right?

344
00:43:55,328 --> 00:43:57,284
So what are you doing here then?

345
00:43:59,048 --> 00:44:03,121
I asked what you're doing here.
- Stop it, Lowie.

346
00:44:03,328 --> 00:44:08,277
What are you doing here?
- Stop that.

347
00:44:08,488 --> 00:44:10,160
Well?
- Stop.

348
00:44:10,368 --> 00:44:12,563
What are you going to do?

349
00:44:16,808 --> 00:44:20,926
Come on!
- So what have you come here for?

350
00:44:25,648 --> 00:44:27,445
Come to pay an old
boyfriend a visit?

351
00:44:27,648 --> 00:44:30,037
Drop it, OK? It's my business.

352
00:44:32,768 --> 00:44:34,326
Right. Fine.

353
00:44:35,648 --> 00:44:38,640
So you're no longer a
Strobbe? I'll remember that.

354
00:44:41,248 --> 00:44:42,283
Up here.

355
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:46,637
Pass me the
ketchup, kid brother.

356
00:44:50,608 --> 00:44:52,599
Right on his arse!

357
00:45:20,488 --> 00:45:22,240
If you need me, I'm next door.

358
00:45:25,568 --> 00:45:27,320
Good night.
- Good night.

359
00:45:29,088 --> 00:45:30,203
Good night.

360
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:38,998
Good night.
- Good night.

361
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:47,881
Sylvie stayed at our
place for 3 weeks.

362
00:45:48,608 --> 00:45:52,601
While I wrote lines, she read
books that improved her mind.

363
00:45:52,808 --> 00:45:55,368
She must have been disgusted
by the way we lived.

364
00:45:55,568 --> 00:45:59,402
But she didn't say anything.
She watched us in silence.

365
00:45:59,608 --> 00:46:04,523
Get up, Dad. Fuck!

366
00:46:18,328 --> 00:46:22,287
This is Gunther Strobbe speaking.
My dad can't come to work today.

367
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:26,117
He's sick. Yes.

368
00:46:26,328 --> 00:46:29,638
Yes, the doctor...
What did you say?

369
00:46:29,848 --> 00:46:35,844
Yes, the doctor said he's
got gastric flu. Thank you.

370
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:37,362
Here.
- Yeah, yeah.

371
00:46:37,568 --> 00:46:41,277
He's doing it again. Shut up!
- Come, come, come.

372
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:55,006
They shit on everything.

373
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,599
Bloody hell!
- Shut up, damn you!

374
00:46:58,808 --> 00:47:00,321
Birdbrain!

375
00:47:20,728 --> 00:47:23,162
That one won't shit on
your washing again, Ma.

376
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:27,284
Silly idiot!

377
00:47:45,368 --> 00:47:46,881
You're not gonna do it?
- I am.

378
00:47:47,088 --> 00:47:49,727
Go on, do it.
- No, no.

379
00:47:49,928 --> 00:47:52,237
Go on, throw it in there.

380
00:48:18,008 --> 00:48:23,560
So tell me who it was. It's that simple.
- I'm not a snitch.

381
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:28,243
You've got a week to
think about it. Understand?

382
00:48:28,608 --> 00:48:30,599
Go on. You can go.

383
00:48:34,928 --> 00:48:36,919
Are you coming, Christie?

384
00:48:37,128 --> 00:48:38,800
It's Sylvie.
- Sylvie.

385
00:48:39,008 --> 00:48:44,128
To my huge surprise, Sylvie accepted
my father's invitation to go to the bar.

386
00:48:44,328 --> 00:48:46,319
Yes?
- Of course.

387
00:48:46,528 --> 00:48:50,680
Which bar are you going to?
- Which bar? We'll see.

388
00:48:50,888 --> 00:48:52,401
Will André be there?

389
00:48:52,608 --> 00:48:54,007
Will André be there?

390
00:48:55,128 --> 00:48:58,803
How should I know? I'm not clairvoyant!
- OK, fine.

391
00:48:59,008 --> 00:49:03,798
Of course André would be in the
bar. He was always in the bar.

392
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:07,398
And everyone, except Sylvie,
knew he was her biological father.

393
00:49:07,608 --> 00:49:11,237
Hey, André!
- Look who's here! Hi, guys.

394
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,916
He wouldn't make
it to Christmas.

395
00:49:14,128 --> 00:49:17,723
So it was high time he met his
daughter, my father thought.

396
00:49:17,928 --> 00:49:23,844
Have a look how I have to shit.
- Keep your clothes on.

397
00:49:24,048 --> 00:49:27,040
I'll never have to use a toilet
again. Everything drips into...

398
00:49:29,368 --> 00:49:31,723
See?
- That's disgusting!

399
00:49:33,168 --> 00:49:37,525
I'll flush it. Here. Wait.

400
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:48,484
André, you're standing
at the bar, having a shit.

401
00:49:48,688 --> 00:49:54,365
You've no idea how much I
save on loo roll every month!

402
00:49:54,568 --> 00:49:55,887
Nice one!

403
00:49:56,088 --> 00:50:03,927
Having a shit in the park isn't
easy, you can't find any loo paper!

404
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:07,478
Christ, guys, I see you've
brought a pretty chick with you.

405
00:50:07,928 --> 00:50:11,045
But if the police find out her
age, you'll be in deep shit.

406
00:50:11,248 --> 00:50:13,487
She's family, André.

407
00:50:14,088 --> 00:50:19,879
André. André, this
is our little Sylvie.

408
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:27,048
Your Rosie's daughter?
- Yes.

409
00:50:35,248 --> 00:50:38,797
Bloody hell, what
a beautiful kid!

410
00:50:42,408 --> 00:50:45,445
You're as beautiful as your ma.

411
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:50,886
How is your mum?
- Fine.

412
00:50:51,168 --> 00:50:52,647
She's fine.

413
00:50:52,848 --> 00:50:59,083
Sylvie, I'm going to buy
you a drink. A drink! Here.

414
00:51:00,408 --> 00:51:02,797
A diet lemonade.
- A diet lemonade.

415
00:51:03,128 --> 00:51:07,804
You're not gonna be all precious? Here,
a diesel. That's what we drink here.

416
00:51:08,008 --> 00:51:12,798
Hey, a lemonade.
- Can't you stand up for yourself?

417
00:51:13,008 --> 00:51:16,887
Get back behind your bar, quick!
- Leave her alone.

418
00:51:17,488 --> 00:51:20,400
Look. Look. See?

419
00:51:31,848 --> 00:51:34,806
That shut you up?

420
00:51:35,728 --> 00:51:38,640
I even asked the park keeper

421
00:51:38,848 --> 00:51:42,557
But he said, "You
must really be joking!"

422
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:49,446
Try it on someone else, son I
didn't think that very fair, you see

423
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:56,121
It was already running out of my
bum So I went behind a big tree.

424
00:51:57,048 --> 00:52:01,200
Having a shit in
the park isn't easy

425
00:52:01,448 --> 00:52:06,920
Filthy faggot and your
gob... stinks... of beer

426
00:52:07,688 --> 00:52:11,522
One more time,
it's a great song.

427
00:52:14,568 --> 00:52:16,957
Stop it, you'll hit the slot machine.
- Move.

428
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:22,037
Hey, Beefcake, you winning?
- Yes, I'm winning.

429
00:52:22,248 --> 00:52:28,847
Stop that, Petrol. Give me that.
- We're at home here, aren't we?

430
00:52:29,048 --> 00:52:32,757
You're not allowed to do anything here.
- Stop it.

431
00:52:40,888 --> 00:52:43,448
If I may...

432
00:52:48,568 --> 00:52:54,359
Thanks, Sylvie, now
I can die in peace.

433
00:53:22,088 --> 00:53:23,123
What do you look like?

434
00:53:28,768 --> 00:53:30,360
Come on... take that coat off.

435
00:53:31,088 --> 00:53:32,567
What a stink!

436
00:53:35,648 --> 00:53:37,161
Where have you been?

437
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:43,319
The miracle has taken place
The miracle has taken place

438
00:53:43,528 --> 00:53:48,158
My pussy is wet And of
rain there is no trace

439
00:53:51,568 --> 00:53:54,446
Upstairs! Upstairs!

440
00:54:07,008 --> 00:54:12,162
What's wrong with the pussy song?
- Did you teach her?

441
00:54:12,368 --> 00:54:17,123
No. André taught her.

442
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:24,800
Did you see André?

443
00:54:26,488 --> 00:54:31,562
Was André there?
- Rosie. Rosie, we're sorry.

444
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,077
We're sorry about everything!

445
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:39,287
Sorry, Rosie.

446
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:46,601
We're sorry, Rosie.

447
00:54:46,928 --> 00:54:48,680
What've you been up to here?
- Help me.

448
00:54:48,888 --> 00:54:52,767
Help me, help me. What have you...
- Open the boot.

449
00:54:52,968 --> 00:54:55,323
Have you been here for 3 weeks?
- Where else?

450
00:54:55,528 --> 00:54:57,723
How would I know?
- I was here.

451
00:54:57,928 --> 00:54:59,407
Put your case in, you silly cow.

452
00:55:02,128 --> 00:55:03,117
Petrol.

453
00:55:05,048 --> 00:55:06,606
What?
- Come here.

454
00:55:06,808 --> 00:55:10,926
What's the matter?
- He's punching her in the kisser.

455
00:55:12,048 --> 00:55:17,600
So? She said she didn't need me any
more. She can sort it out herself.

456
00:55:22,168 --> 00:55:23,965
Calm down.
- Yeah, calm down.

457
00:55:24,168 --> 00:55:26,477
You've had it now! Calm down.
- Hey!

458
00:55:26,688 --> 00:55:29,282
Did you hear me? I've had
enough of your dramatics!

459
00:55:33,248 --> 00:55:34,681
It's always the same.

460
00:55:41,328 --> 00:55:44,320
It occurred to me again,
beautiful things got destroyed

461
00:55:44,528 --> 00:55:46,041
or left our village.

462
00:55:57,568 --> 00:56:02,483
Stupid bitch! I do
what I like, got it?

463
00:56:03,368 --> 00:56:07,646
No one's gonna tell me
otherwise. And don't get catty!

464
00:56:07,848 --> 00:56:12,205
Very funny, miaow, miaow.
Go poke fun at someone else!

465
00:56:13,648 --> 00:56:19,200
You can all kiss my arse! All
of you! Bunch of dickheads!

466
00:56:27,288 --> 00:56:28,641
Mr. Strobbe.

467
00:56:30,168 --> 00:56:31,362
Take a seat.

468
00:56:35,968 --> 00:56:37,447
What can I do for you?

469
00:56:40,848 --> 00:56:44,238
It was me. I made
the toilets overflow.

470
00:56:49,408 --> 00:56:51,876
Then I have no choice
but to expel you.

471
00:56:52,688 --> 00:56:54,041
OK.

472
00:56:56,088 --> 00:56:57,567
You can go.

473
00:57:01,248 --> 00:57:04,718
Gunther, it can't
carry on like this.

474
00:57:06,608 --> 00:57:08,564
What are we to do with you?

475
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:14,325
I'm going to send someone round.

476
00:57:18,848 --> 00:57:20,201
Go on.

477
00:58:21,888 --> 00:58:25,119
There are 2 people
I hate. 2 women.

478
00:58:27,528 --> 00:58:31,521
One gave birth to me, the
other was carrying my offspring.

479
00:58:31,728 --> 00:58:34,037
You could say there was
a connection between them,

480
00:58:34,248 --> 00:58:36,808
but that's probably
just an impression.

481
00:58:37,008 --> 00:58:41,718
One's mind is confused when
one is about to stop being a son

482
00:58:41,928 --> 00:58:44,317
and become a father.

483
00:59:34,728 --> 00:59:38,482
I'm looking for Marcel Strobbe.
- Marcel?

484
00:59:38,688 --> 00:59:41,805
Have you come to see Celle?
- Yes.

485
00:59:43,928 --> 00:59:47,807
Celle, get up.
You've got a visitor.

486
00:59:48,688 --> 00:59:50,918
It may take a while. He's
only just gone to bed.

487
00:59:51,128 --> 00:59:55,963
I've got time. I'll wait.
- Take a seat.

488
00:59:56,168 --> 00:59:59,638
Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

489
00:59:59,848 --> 01:00:03,397
No? A coffee? Kid, go...
- No, it's fine, thanks.

490
01:00:04,808 --> 01:00:07,197
So you've come to see our Celle?
- Yes.

491
01:00:08,208 --> 01:00:14,204
Celle, come downstairs. There's
a chick waiting for you down here.

492
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:18,759
What did you say?
- There's a chick to see you.

493
01:00:19,168 --> 01:00:22,160
What's her name?
- What's her name?

494
01:00:22,848 --> 01:00:24,839
What's your name?
- Nele Fockedey.

495
01:00:25,448 --> 01:00:27,837
Nele Fock...
Fuck-a-day? - Yes.

496
01:00:31,608 --> 01:00:34,918
Fuck-a-day. - A fuck a
day keeps the doctor away.

497
01:00:35,128 --> 01:00:42,967
Fancy being called that! Celle,
her name's Nele Fuck-a-day.

498
01:00:43,168 --> 01:00:48,288
Dickhead! Let me sleep.
- No, seriously, Celle.

499
01:00:48,488 --> 01:00:54,085
What does she look like?
- Not bad. Blonde, around 60 kg

500
01:00:54,288 --> 01:00:56,882
and a nice pair of tits!
- And white knickers!

501
01:00:57,408 --> 01:00:59,763
Bloody hell!

502
01:01:01,688 --> 01:01:04,202
Fuckin' hell! 2 crates of beer!

503
01:01:05,248 --> 01:01:06,567
Beefcake?
- Yes?

504
01:01:06,848 --> 01:01:10,318
It's not that woman from last night?
- How should I know?

505
01:01:10,808 --> 01:01:15,245
Ask her.
- Are you that woman from last night?

506
01:01:15,748 --> 01:01:20,317
Hold on...
- She's not saying anything, Celle.

507
01:01:20,528 --> 01:01:24,840
Don't tell me she's pregnant.
- No, hold on, I think...

508
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:29,280
Come on, come downstairs. I'm not
having anything more to do with it.

509
01:01:34,088 --> 01:01:37,876
Shit. Gunther!

510
01:01:40,768 --> 01:01:42,326
Gunther!

511
01:01:42,728 --> 01:01:44,320
Come here, son.

512
01:01:46,168 --> 01:01:47,681
Gunther!

513
01:02:20,848 --> 01:02:22,566
A cigarette.

514
01:02:33,568 --> 01:02:34,967
What's going on?

515
01:02:35,608 --> 01:02:38,406
What's going on? I
don't know this woman.

516
01:02:38,608 --> 01:02:42,396
Are you bullshitting me?
- Mr. Strobbe, I'm Nele Fockedey

517
01:02:42,608 --> 01:02:45,042
from the Department
for Child Protection.

518
01:02:45,248 --> 01:02:49,287
I've come to see the conditions in
which your son is being brought up.

519
01:02:49,648 --> 01:02:51,878
Mr. Strobbe, this
situation is unacceptable.

520
01:02:55,168 --> 01:02:58,240
Why isn't the boy
living with his mother?

521
01:02:58,448 --> 01:03:00,518
Ask him yourself, madam.

522
01:03:04,168 --> 01:03:06,523
Wouldn't you rather
live with your mum?

523
01:03:09,288 --> 01:03:13,884
Tell me about your mum.
- My mother is a whore, madam.

524
01:03:25,528 --> 01:03:30,397
That's it, have another
drink. Marcel! Marcel...

525
01:03:31,768 --> 01:03:39,163
If they take him away, I'll kill myself.
- Pull yourself together. Stop drinking.

526
01:03:40,408 --> 01:03:42,080
Stop drinking?
- Yes.

527
01:03:42,288 --> 01:03:46,247
Stop drinking...
- Gonna hit your mother, are you?

528
01:03:47,048 --> 01:03:48,163
Go on!

529
01:03:52,008 --> 01:03:56,126
Bloody hell, Celle. Bloody hell.
- Someone snitched on us.

530
01:03:56,968 --> 01:04:00,404
It was you! You
called that woman.

531
01:04:00,688 --> 01:04:02,644
What?
- Don't be stupid, Celle.

532
01:04:02,928 --> 01:04:05,362
You called that woman!
- I didn't.

533
01:04:07,008 --> 01:04:08,236
You did.
- I didn't.

534
01:04:08,448 --> 01:04:09,927
Shut your mouth.
- No, I won't.

535
01:04:10,168 --> 01:04:11,203
Shut it.
- No.

536
01:04:11,408 --> 01:04:12,921
Shut it.
- No, I won't.

537
01:04:13,168 --> 01:04:14,521
Shut your mouth.

538
01:04:15,848 --> 01:04:17,566
Fuckin' hell!

539
01:04:17,768 --> 01:04:20,680
Let go of me. Let go of me.

540
01:04:25,448 --> 01:04:26,597
Stay there.

541
01:04:27,688 --> 01:04:32,000
Fuckin' hell! Fuckin' hell!

542
01:04:34,848 --> 01:04:38,284
Fuckin' hell! Traitor!

543
01:04:42,008 --> 01:04:43,566
Traitor.

544
01:04:47,088 --> 01:04:50,080
You're betraying
your own family.

545
01:04:53,048 --> 01:04:55,118
You're betraying
your own family.

546
01:04:56,248 --> 01:04:58,000
You're betraying your own blood.

547
01:05:01,008 --> 01:05:03,044
You're betraying your own blood.
- Let go.

548
01:05:03,248 --> 01:05:11,007
It was me. I called that woman.
It was me who called that woman.

549
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:17,317
I called that woman. Marcel.

550
01:05:18,048 --> 01:05:24,044
I called that woman.
I called that woman.

551
01:05:28,768 --> 01:05:30,121
I'm going to put that in too.

552
01:05:40,448 --> 01:05:44,680
Once he'd calmed down,
he was overcome by shame.

553
01:05:44,888 --> 01:05:47,721
Shame and realisation.

554
01:05:48,448 --> 01:05:51,884
He opened the phone book
and phoned a rehab clinic.

555
01:05:52,488 --> 01:05:55,719
Then he put my name
down for boarding school.

556
01:05:59,728 --> 01:06:06,327
"It's better this way, son,"
he mumbled. "Until I'm better. "

557
01:07:16,248 --> 01:07:19,718
He'd said my father was crazy and
called my uncles scum from the gutter.

558
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:25,637
Years later, I
bumped into Franky.

559
01:07:25,848 --> 01:07:29,921
...not damaged. Everything's
in very good condition.

560
01:07:34,288 --> 01:07:37,519
How much is this?
- 4 euros.

561
01:07:38,568 --> 01:07:43,358
For a beer-drinking smurf?
- Not many were made, sir.

562
01:07:43,568 --> 01:07:49,086
Not many were made? Look. Made in
Taiwan. On the bottom of his shoes.

563
01:07:49,928 --> 01:07:53,637
Probably made by kids, too.
- Hey, aren't you...

564
01:07:54,608 --> 01:07:55,961
Franky.

565
01:07:57,888 --> 01:08:01,597
Did your dad say you could talk to me?
- Long time no see!

566
01:08:02,688 --> 01:08:07,364
What a coincidence! I thought of you
last week. At Reetveerdegem cemetery.

567
01:08:07,568 --> 01:08:12,039
I walked past your father's
grave and wondered how you were.

568
01:08:17,048 --> 01:08:22,247
So, what are you up to now?
- All sorts, whatever pays the rent.

569
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:31,438
Still got your train collection?
- Yes. But it's much bigger now.

570
01:08:31,648 --> 01:08:33,161
Is it?
- More sophisticated.

571
01:08:33,368 --> 01:08:36,724
Everything's computer controlled.
You should come and see.

572
01:08:36,928 --> 01:08:41,479
There I sat, with Franky
and a beer, catching up.

573
01:08:41,688 --> 01:08:48,321
Talking about years gone by that
we can't go back to and improve.

574
01:08:48,528 --> 01:08:50,678
D'you ever come
to Reetveerdegem?

575
01:08:56,808 --> 01:08:59,368
D'you ever come
to Reetveerdegem?

576
01:09:03,648 --> 01:09:09,405
Every 5 years or so, I go back
to Reetveerdegem for no reason.

577
01:09:10,448 --> 01:09:15,476
It suddenly appears, this
need to go and see my uncles.

578
01:09:20,608 --> 01:09:23,520
After that, I visit
my father's grave.

579
01:09:23,728 --> 01:09:25,844
Seeing as I'm there.

580
01:09:26,608 --> 01:09:28,724
It no longer makes
any difference to him.

581
01:09:28,928 --> 01:09:35,367
But I'm there. And he is
too, one way or another.

582
01:10:38,488 --> 01:10:40,718
Strobbe! Eyes to the front.

583
01:10:40,928 --> 01:10:44,398
You weren't paying attention?
- No, I wasn't paying attention.

584
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:48,122
4 pages, by tomorrow.
- What about, sir?

585
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:52,037
Write an absurd story about Darius.
- OK.

586
01:11:16,848 --> 01:11:20,045
Strobbe. Read this
out to the class.

587
01:11:20,648 --> 01:11:25,881
Boys. Quiet. We're going to
listen to Gunther's story.

588
01:11:27,968 --> 01:11:31,040
Darius, the son of
Xerxes, the king of Persia,

589
01:11:31,248 --> 01:11:36,766
took a can of Sprite out of the vending
machine in his dad's palace and...

590
01:11:58,568 --> 01:12:00,638
Hey! What on earth is going on?

591
01:12:35,688 --> 01:12:37,599
It was quiet at home.

592
01:12:39,768 --> 01:12:45,604
Dad was trying to kick his addiction,
Koen had moved in with his new love,

593
01:12:45,808 --> 01:12:49,084
Petrol was in prison
for something minor

594
01:12:49,288 --> 01:12:54,442
and Beefcake had ended up in
hospital after a cycling race.

595
01:12:55,328 --> 01:13:01,119
Come here. Thanks for coming.
- You're welcome.

596
01:13:01,328 --> 01:13:05,082
What have you been up to?
- I went over the mountains too fast.

597
01:13:05,288 --> 01:13:08,041
Yeah.
- I've done things, Ma,

598
01:13:08,248 --> 01:13:12,560
things that Koen can only dream of.
But I went over the mountains too fast.

599
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:16,727
Yeah.
- I'd lined up 4 Trappist beers.

600
01:13:16,928 --> 01:13:18,327
I added 2 whiskies...

601
01:13:18,528 --> 01:13:25,366
He hadn't done much cycling,
except possibly metaphorically.

602
01:13:26,968 --> 01:13:29,641
Beefcake still couldn't
get over Koen's victory.

603
01:13:29,848 --> 01:13:36,162
So he'd designed his own
alcoholic race. His Tour de France.

604
01:13:36,368 --> 01:13:43,285
A sort of board game on a map of France,
with kilometres converted into drink.

605
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:51,281
Because Beefcake wanted to be
the most accomplished boozer,

606
01:13:51,488 --> 01:13:55,959
his race would be spread over
a number of days, like the Tour,

607
01:13:56,168 --> 01:13:59,558
and wouldn't be
limited to just lager.

608
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:05,167
Like in the case of the stages of
the Tour, 3 jerseys could be won.

609
01:14:05,368 --> 01:14:10,283
Yellow for the winner, green for best
sprinter, the 'down the hatch' king,

610
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:13,560
and the polka dot jersey could
be earned in the mountains,

611
01:14:13,768 --> 01:14:17,556
where you got ahead by
drinking stronger drinks.

612
01:14:47,448 --> 01:14:48,722
Here.

613
01:15:06,248 --> 01:15:07,567
I need a piss.

614
01:15:09,888 --> 01:15:12,356
A woman of your size
and such a tiny bladder.

615
01:15:12,568 --> 01:15:16,083
The toilet's too
narrow! I can't get in.

616
01:15:33,568 --> 01:15:34,887
Yellow.
- Wait till tomorrow.

617
01:15:40,248 --> 01:15:42,682
Bye, guys.
- See you tomorrow.

618
01:16:38,608 --> 01:16:43,728
If Beefcake hadn't done
something stupid, he could've won.

619
01:16:44,248 --> 01:16:48,002
We can only guess what was going
through his mind when, on day 12,

620
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:51,405
he cycled up the Mont
Ventoux like a stud on heat.

621
01:17:12,408 --> 01:17:14,717
Beefcake. Beefcake's
hit the deck.

622
01:17:15,408 --> 01:17:16,921
Beefcake's hit the deck.

623
01:17:17,488 --> 01:17:18,841
Zulma.

624
01:17:19,848 --> 01:17:22,123
Gunther. Light out.

625
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:01,278
This surprised you, son?

626
01:18:03,168 --> 01:18:04,442
How are you?
- Fine. And you?

627
01:18:04,648 --> 01:18:07,446
Fine. Shall I take that?
- If you like.

628
01:18:08,248 --> 01:18:10,398
What have you got in there?
- My books.

629
01:18:10,608 --> 01:18:11,757
Comic books, I suppose?

630
01:18:28,768 --> 01:18:31,566
Hey, look who's fuckin' here!

631
01:18:36,568 --> 01:18:38,081
How's things?
- Fine.

632
01:18:38,288 --> 01:18:40,802
You're looking good.
- Thanks.

633
01:18:44,928 --> 01:18:46,964
Hello, kid.
- Hi.

634
01:18:47,928 --> 01:18:51,204
Hi, ugly.
- How's things?

635
01:18:51,408 --> 01:18:55,242
I'm off, guys.
- Bye, Beefcake

636
01:18:55,448 --> 01:18:57,359
Bye.
- See you...

637
01:18:58,608 --> 01:19:02,283
See you in a month or 2.
- Watch out, they'll keep you in.

638
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:05,605
Very funny. Really
funny. Really.

639
01:19:11,848 --> 01:19:13,440
Hello.
- Hello.

640
01:19:14,848 --> 01:19:17,408
Can we take a look round?
- Go ahead.

641
01:19:21,088 --> 01:19:22,237
There.

642
01:19:24,088 --> 01:19:27,603
Choose a pair of trainers.
Whichever you like.

643
01:19:27,808 --> 01:19:30,163
Even the most expensive.
- What for?

644
01:19:30,648 --> 01:19:33,481
To run in, of course.
- I don't go running.

645
01:19:33,688 --> 01:19:36,760
I don't like running.
- What d'you mean?

646
01:19:36,968 --> 01:19:40,722
A real man runs.
We'll run together.

647
01:19:40,928 --> 01:19:43,806
There's a race tomorrow.
I've put your name down.

648
01:20:42,808 --> 01:20:46,687
You're bloody good at running!
You can run really fast.

649
01:20:46,968 --> 01:20:51,200
I used to be good at it too.
I even won a gas cooker once.

650
01:20:51,408 --> 01:20:54,480
Your mum was pleased.
- You've told me that loads of times.

651
01:20:55,528 --> 01:20:57,246
Yes, that's true.

652
01:21:00,008 --> 01:21:02,602
Are they comfortable?
- Sure.

653
01:21:04,368 --> 01:21:08,964
They're not too tight at the front?
- No.

654
01:21:12,568 --> 01:21:16,322
I've got to go back in
Sunday evening, at 5 o'clock.

655
01:21:16,528 --> 01:21:22,967
If I'm completely sober, I
can come home for good. So...

656
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:28,598
I'm going to stay
at boarding school.

657
01:21:46,888 --> 01:21:50,881
D'you like it there?
- Yes.

658
01:21:58,648 --> 01:22:01,208
All the shit I
went through, son...

659
01:22:03,888 --> 01:22:05,844
you're not gonna
go through that.

660
01:22:07,288 --> 01:22:12,043
I can see it in your
eyes. You've got...

661
01:22:16,528 --> 01:22:17,677
I don't know.

662
01:22:20,408 --> 01:22:22,000
You're different.

663
01:22:24,448 --> 01:22:25,927
You're a Strobbe.

664
01:22:28,328 --> 01:22:29,807
But you're different.

665
01:23:59,048 --> 01:24:03,678
There was a slight chance
the baby would be born dead.

666
01:24:03,888 --> 01:24:06,356
Or would turn out to be black.

667
01:24:07,248 --> 01:24:11,958
In both cases I would find
it hard to hide my delight.

668
01:24:28,928 --> 01:24:32,716
And push, push, push. OK,
keep going, keep going.

669
01:24:32,928 --> 01:24:36,125
Keep going, keep
going. OK, rest now.

670
01:24:37,568 --> 01:24:39,798
Could you spare a cigarette?

671
01:25:01,768 --> 01:25:05,078
Life had been passed
on, like a baton

672
01:25:05,288 --> 01:25:08,360
in an eternal relay race, the
reason for which no one knows

673
01:25:08,568 --> 01:25:12,959
but in which everyone
clings to their misfortunes.

674
01:25:17,568 --> 01:25:19,638
Hey, you. Hi.

675
01:25:22,288 --> 01:25:27,282
Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine, Gunther.

676
01:25:30,568 --> 01:25:35,596
We're going to make a good job of
it. This baby chose to be with us.

677
01:25:36,928 --> 01:25:40,523
Babies choose their parents
and not the other way round.

678
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:44,644
This little man chose us.

679
01:25:47,328 --> 01:25:52,356
So you think kids choose their parents?
- Yes.

680
01:25:58,048 --> 01:25:59,242
What a load of crap!

681
01:26:01,608 --> 01:26:05,567
You're always a bastard, when
you abandon a woman and her kid.

682
01:26:06,448 --> 01:26:09,804
But that's because you weren't
enough of a bastard to leave her

683
01:26:10,008 --> 01:26:12,568
before you had
made her pregnant.

684
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:30,206
Dear Mr. Strobbe, Dear Gunther,

685
01:26:30,408 --> 01:26:34,765
We read, with particular
interest, your first novel-to-be.

686
01:26:34,968 --> 01:26:38,756
Our advisors were all positive.

687
01:26:38,968 --> 01:26:42,324
So we would like to
invite you to Amsterdam

688
01:26:42,528 --> 01:26:44,962
to discuss a number
of things with you.

689
01:27:09,328 --> 01:27:14,322
5 NOVELS LATER

690
01:27:38,408 --> 01:27:39,966
Hey, kid.

691
01:27:41,248 --> 01:27:43,239
Hey, come here.

692
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:45,957
Well, well.

693
01:27:49,008 --> 01:27:50,999
Big guy.
- I'll go and get some beers.

694
01:27:51,208 --> 01:27:55,087
Kid? A beer? You too?
- Hello, Ma.

695
01:27:56,208 --> 01:28:00,520
Come on, sit down. I wanted
to ask you something, kid.

696
01:28:01,248 --> 01:28:08,928
Someone phoned me. A professor
in folklore phoned me.

697
01:28:09,128 --> 01:28:13,121
They've started a
drinking songs project.

698
01:28:13,328 --> 01:28:16,286
They want to create a record of
all kinds of songs in dialect,

699
01:28:16,488 --> 01:28:19,446
per region. Get it?

700
01:28:19,648 --> 01:28:23,766
So my question is, d'you
still know any songs like that?

701
01:28:23,968 --> 01:28:26,846
The pussy song.
- The pussy song.

702
01:28:27,048 --> 01:28:29,437
The pussy song. Yes, that's it.

703
01:28:29,648 --> 01:28:33,482
The pussy song. Are
you going to start?

704
01:28:33,688 --> 01:28:37,363
What?
- Singing. I'll write it down.

705
01:28:37,568 --> 01:28:40,366
What about Granny?
- She can sing too.

706
01:28:40,568 --> 01:28:42,240
She's got dementia.

707
01:28:42,448 --> 01:28:48,683
She's got dementia.
- So? Maybe she can help us.

708
01:28:51,088 --> 01:28:53,966
Come on, if we start
singing maybe she'll join in.

709
01:28:57,608 --> 01:29:00,361
Go on.
- I'm not going to start singing here.

710
01:29:01,448 --> 01:29:06,283
You going to let us down then?
- If you want to look at it like that...

711
01:29:06,488 --> 01:29:10,197
Well, I do look at it like that.

712
01:29:12,248 --> 01:29:16,400
Come on, kid. A professor
in folklore phoned me!

713
01:29:16,608 --> 01:29:22,763
They're creating a record of the songs,
to be part of the cultural heritage...

714
01:29:22,968 --> 01:29:26,483
...thing. Well?

715
01:29:27,928 --> 01:29:30,886
You're the cultured
one, aren't you?

716
01:29:31,728 --> 01:29:33,719
You're always on stage.

717
01:29:36,208 --> 01:29:40,599
If we want to know how you're doing,
kid, we have to read the newspaper.

718
01:29:43,488 --> 01:29:45,444
Our little author...

719
01:29:47,728 --> 01:29:51,437
Your family needs you now.
What's the first verse?

720
01:29:51,648 --> 01:29:53,639
No more crap.

721
01:29:54,088 --> 01:29:57,876
The miracle has taken place
The miracle has taken place

722
01:29:58,088 --> 01:29:59,726
That's it. That's it.

723
01:30:00,248 --> 01:30:04,127
My pussy is wet And of
rain there is no trace

724
01:30:04,328 --> 01:30:08,765
My pussy is wet And of
rain there is no trace

725
01:30:08,968 --> 01:30:12,756
Great, kid. Second verse.
- I only know the first verse.

726
01:30:12,968 --> 01:30:14,003
Come on, come on.

727
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:18,963
The miracle has taken place
The miracle has taken place

728
01:30:19,168 --> 01:30:22,877
And then? Come on. The
miracle has taken place

729
01:30:23,088 --> 01:30:25,807
Come on, Ma. The
miracle has taken place

730
01:30:26,008 --> 01:30:30,638
My pussy is wet And of
rain there is no trace

731
01:30:30,848 --> 01:30:34,841
No, I only know the first verse.
- We're not drunk enough.

732
01:30:35,048 --> 01:30:38,836
You need to be drunk, to
sing drinking songs. Kid?

733
01:30:40,488 --> 01:30:43,685
Come on, let's go to a bar.
- Hold on, guys.

734
01:30:43,888 --> 01:30:47,676
I'm going to take Granny back to her
room first. I'll see you in a minute.

735
01:30:47,888 --> 01:30:50,004
The tit song, d'you
still know that?

736
01:30:50,208 --> 01:30:53,917
I do. The tit song.

737
01:30:54,128 --> 01:30:57,438
1 is not enough
And 3 are too many

738
01:30:57,648 --> 01:31:00,446
If they're spread out a bit
Lookin' at 'em makes you cross-eyed

739
01:31:00,648 --> 01:31:02,445
Tits!

740
01:31:11,168 --> 01:31:13,841
Watch out, it'll
end up on the floor.

741
01:31:18,528 --> 01:31:23,079
This made you laugh last time,
d'you remember? My roll-up.

742
01:31:26,168 --> 01:31:28,762
You said it was for fishermen.

743
01:31:32,328 --> 01:31:34,796
She didn't say anything
towards the end.

744
01:31:35,568 --> 01:31:40,005
Maybe she was fed up with always
being told she'd forgotten everything,

745
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:44,121
that she was always wrong, that she
could no longer tell her children

746
01:31:44,328 --> 01:31:48,480
from her grandchildren or
even her great-grandchildren.

747
01:31:49,368 --> 01:31:50,687
That's OK. It's clean.

748
01:31:51,848 --> 01:31:54,601
Let me move that.

749
01:31:54,808 --> 01:31:58,323
If she didn't feel like
speaking, then I spoke.

750
01:31:58,528 --> 01:32:00,803
Even if she didn't
take anything more in.

751
01:32:01,008 --> 01:32:04,842
I told her who I was,
what she had meant to me,

752
01:32:05,768 --> 01:32:09,522
that I was Gunther, the son
of one of her sons, Celle.

753
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:15,123
That she was my grandmother, but
that she'd been a mother to me.

754
01:32:15,328 --> 01:32:18,764
I thanked her for the year she
looked after me and my father.

755
01:32:18,968 --> 01:32:21,198
We do keep-fit exercises
in the courtyard.

756
01:32:21,408 --> 01:32:23,399
To start the morning refreshed.
- No way.

757
01:32:23,608 --> 01:32:26,406
Yes, yes. Absolutely.

758
01:32:26,608 --> 01:32:29,361
Oranges?
- Yes, oranges and everything.

759
01:32:30,808 --> 01:32:32,241
Every morning.

760
01:32:35,568 --> 01:32:39,766
Shall we go and play billiards?
- No.

761
01:32:40,248 --> 01:32:42,603
Shall we go and play billiards?

762
01:32:46,688 --> 01:32:47,837
Celle.
- No.

763
01:32:48,048 --> 01:32:49,879
What d'you mean?
- No!

764
01:32:50,088 --> 01:32:54,081
No, no. Celle, people
think you're crazy

765
01:32:54,288 --> 01:32:58,884
because you've spent 3 months
in that psychiatric clinic.

766
01:32:59,088 --> 01:33:03,081
They say to us "Your Celle's crazy. "
- Let them say it.

767
01:33:03,288 --> 01:33:07,566
Let them say it...
Just show your kisser.

768
01:33:07,768 --> 01:33:11,363
You're coming to play billiards.
- Come on, guys.

769
01:33:11,568 --> 01:33:15,243
I've got to be back there
at 5 o'clock tomorrow. Sober.

770
01:33:15,448 --> 01:33:19,680
I'm not going looking for trouble.
Want me to turn up there pissed?

771
01:33:20,048 --> 01:33:25,520
No, no.
- Listen to me a minute, Celle.

772
01:33:31,248 --> 01:33:33,921
They're letting you
out in a few weeks.

773
01:33:35,368 --> 01:33:39,680
The guy in charge gives you a pat on
the back, you've officially dried out.

774
01:33:40,768 --> 01:33:45,046
Dried out, yes.
- You'll start working again.

775
01:33:46,968 --> 01:33:51,803
No postman has got as many
bars on his round as you.

776
01:33:52,008 --> 01:33:53,999
That's true.
- That used to be great.

777
01:33:54,208 --> 01:33:57,598
But now you're going to have to
say no, pal. No, to all those beers,

778
01:33:57,808 --> 01:34:01,517
to all those whiskies,
to all those ports.

779
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:05,277
No, no, madam, I don't drink
any more. I'm in a hurry.

780
01:34:05,488 --> 01:34:10,482
How will you be able to cope if you
can't even come and play billiards?

781
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,087
Exactly.

782
01:34:16,968 --> 01:34:21,678
You're right. I'm coming with
you. I'm not staying home here.

783
01:34:21,888 --> 01:34:25,881
You're not going to do something stupid?
- Something stupid, Ma!

784
01:34:26,088 --> 01:34:29,160
He's in good hands.
- I shall be sensible.

785
01:34:29,368 --> 01:34:32,519
Just a game with my pals.

786
01:34:35,288 --> 01:34:38,803
I'll be back before you
even realise I've gone.

787
01:34:40,568 --> 01:34:46,165
What? What? Don't forget
that race tomorrow.

788
01:34:46,368 --> 01:34:47,881
I'm coming to watch.

789
01:34:49,368 --> 01:34:53,202
He should go to bed on time.
He's got to be in good shape.

790
01:34:53,408 --> 01:34:55,968
Right, see you later.
I won't be long.

791
01:34:56,168 --> 01:34:59,046
Hey, Beefcake.
Where are we going?

792
01:35:05,408 --> 01:35:07,000
Hey, wait for me.

793
01:35:27,328 --> 01:35:29,717
Playing billiards
could last a long time.

794
01:37:06,728 --> 01:37:09,720
I earn my money doing
something I love.

795
01:37:18,288 --> 01:37:20,438
I've met the woman of my dreams.

796
01:37:22,168 --> 01:37:24,807
I had to go and have a kid
with someone else first.

797
01:37:26,568 --> 01:37:28,604
But I met her in the end.

798
01:37:41,728 --> 01:37:45,038
I'll never be a
real dad to the kid.

799
01:37:46,168 --> 01:37:53,643
I try to be... a
good uncle to him.

800
01:38:02,888 --> 01:38:07,803
Thanks for looking after me
and for standing up for me.

801
01:38:13,248 --> 01:38:17,161
Thanks for saying you
phoned that Nele Fockedey.

802
01:39:11,648 --> 01:39:17,644
That's it. Go on. It's
loose. Yes, you did it!

803
01:39:20,208 --> 01:39:21,482
Right then, here we go.

804
01:39:24,328 --> 01:39:26,319
Are you on there OK?
- Yes.

805
01:39:26,528 --> 01:39:31,124
Be careful. Hold on
tight to the handlebar.

806
01:39:31,328 --> 01:39:34,400
Not too fast. Sit up straight.

807
01:39:34,608 --> 01:39:36,087
Are you OK?

808
01:39:56,288 --> 01:40:00,361
OK, keep it straight.
In a straight line. Go!

809
01:40:26,288 --> 01:40:29,041
Did you hurt your knee?

810
01:40:30,088 --> 01:40:32,841
I'm going to let go.
I'm going to let go.

811
01:40:43,168 --> 01:40:46,240
